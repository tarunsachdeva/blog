One point. What an insane game. 

So much anticipation and energy carried us to this point; the city was ready for a celebration. It feels like someone took the ground beneath us, but we're still floating waiting for the drop. I feel deflated, and need to rest.

Good things don't come easy, definitely not for Toronto. 

3-2, heads held high, ready for the next one.
