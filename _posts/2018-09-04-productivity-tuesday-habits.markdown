Productivity is the art of practicing leadership on yourself. In **Productivity Tuesday (PT)**, I'll reflect and share on that practice, and of bridging the gap between intention and the outcomes we seek. Whatever I share by way of advice and tips will come with some kind of empirical evidence or insight from personal experience. 

The first PT is about habits.

Habits are a contrast to one the default framework of productivity - *goal oriented thinking*. Goals are great in that they provide a clear definition of an end state, typically accompanied by a deadline. 

Habits are defined as routines of behaviour that *repeat regularly* and *tend to occur subconciously*. 

Habits can be an extremely powerful framework to achieve our desired outcomes, and have a number of  benefits over the traditional goal-oriented thinking in the context of daily productivity:

- To apply [good goalsetting practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) in everyday life can be a very cumbersome exercise. In particular, it's hard to tell if something is achievable over a long period of time due to inherent uncertainties in life.
- Habits are easier and show progress quickly. Streaks of progress release endorphins that keep you going. Instead of trying to publish a novel, simply writing _something_ [every day]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-27-starting-a-new-habit %}), is much less daunting and requires less continual willpower.

That said, habits aren't for everything. I have recently moved to augmenting my daily routine with a combination of a discrete goal-based and habit based framework. The habit based framework is extremely simple - within a given time period (weeks/months), I define habits to either create, improve, or remove. I've only experimented with habits that recur daily. These include - reading, writing something, coding. For the last few weeks, I've been able to maintain a daily habit of all 3. In the next few weeks, I'll attempt to rebuild a workout habit with this framework.

I've also started [tracking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-30-time %}) these habits.

A recommendation - the first habit to setup is a cycle of regular planning and self reflection. Regular planning at the beginning of, and retrospective at the end of every day/week/month is your personal knowledge and learning loop. It defines the cadence of improving and adjusting your other habits. 

A lot of this comes thinking from [this article](https://fs.blog/2017/06/habits-vs-goals/) from the Farnam Street blog, and this [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/internetVin/status/1019033516028280832).
