Farnam Street was my favorite Internet find for 2018. It's a blog about mental models, decision making and learning. There is also the excellent podcast [The Knowledge Project] which features some really great conversations.

They recently published their [most popular episodes](https://fs.blog/2018/12/tkp-top-5-2018/) of 2018. I also enjoyed the conversation with [Tobi Lutke](https://fs.blog/tobi-lutke/) from Shopify.
