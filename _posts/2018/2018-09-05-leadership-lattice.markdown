I'm kicking off this post following up on the domains of responsibilty outlined in [developing a leadership latticework]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-29-developing-leadership-latticework %}). This learning framework is simply an outline of the areas for which leaders are either directly responsible or accountable.

As a refresher, the domains of responsibility outlined were (updated with links):

* [The Domain of Self Management]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-10-leadership-lattice-self-management %}), concerned with managing yourself as a leader
* [The Individual Domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-12-leadership-practice-individual-domain %}), concerned with the management and growth of individuals
* [The Organization Domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-19-leadership-latticework-organization %}), concerned with how people organize to work together
* [The Application Domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-27-leadership-lattice-application-domain %}), concerned with the specific outputs and outcomes of an organization. 
* [The Impact Domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-04-leadership-lattice-impact-domain %}), concerned with the broader impacts of the organization's collective output

In following weeks, I'll be examining each domain by detailing:

* Guiding Mental Models: These mental models that can help understand the overall responsibility scope of the domain.
* Practices: This outlines the specific practices of the domain. These cover the responsibility scope in more detail. 
* Frameworks: Here I'll cover some of the frameworks that I've picked up along the way that have helped me in the practices above. The sources of these frameworks come from everywhere - experience, blog posts, books. 
* Other Resources: Specific people, authors, books or websites I've found to be a great source of information related to this domain of leadership.

As I come across new sources of knowledge, this framework has helped me file things away, compare one technique to another, or just simply clarify what the job actually is. I want to emphasize that this is my personal framework of _learning_. Hopefully, the structure can be useful to someone other than myself as well.

Next week, I'll cover the Individual Domain, which is concerned with management at an individual level.
