It's Canadian Thanksgiving and I'm spending the weekend with family and catching up on some  podcasts. 

One of my favourites is The Knowledge Project, the podcast of the [The Farnam Street blog](http://www.fs.blog) by Shane Parrish. I often reference Farnam Street in my posts especially around Mental Models. The knowledge project is all signal and features some excellent conversations - some of my favourites being with Ray Dalio, Naval Ravikant, Tobi Lutke, Sanjay Bakshi and Venkatesh Rao. 

I'm also a member of the associated Learning Community of the blog. 

I find myself recommending both the blog and podcast on a regular basis. They have changed my outlook on so much, and informed how I think about learning, personal growth and investing. 

Check out the [Farnam Street blog](https://www.fs.blog/) and [The Knowledge Project podcast](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/).
