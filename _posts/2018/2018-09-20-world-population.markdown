A short post today. I saw this visual yesterday - a cartogram of the world population from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram).

From the post:

> While a geographical map is helpful if you want to find your way around the world, a population cartogram is the representation that we need if we want to know where our fellow humans are at home.

It's a powerful visual that puts a lot into perspective. A very quick analysis of the top 15 most populous countries and how they rank in terms of nominal GDP ([source](http://statisticstimes.com/economy/projected-world-gdp-ranking.php)).

Country | Rank in Population | Rank in GDP
------- | ------------------ | -----------
China | 1 | 2
India | 2 | 7
United States | 3 | 1
Indonesia | 4 | 16 
Brazil | 5 | 9
Pakistan | 6 | 41
Nigeria | 7 | 31
Bangladesh | 8 | 43
Russia | 9 | 11
Mexico | 10 | 15
Japan | 11 | 3
Ethiopia | 12 | (unranked)
Philippines | 13 | 39
Vietnam | 14 | 49
Egypt | 15 | 45
