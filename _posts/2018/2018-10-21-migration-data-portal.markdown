I recently found an incredible [interactive map](https://migrationdataportal.org/data) that shows global trends in migration. For every country in the world, you can see it's total immigrant population, % of immigrants to total population, and also the top 3 countries where migrants are coming from - among other information.

For instance, for Canada - we have 7.9M migrants (21% of our total population), and the top 3 countries are China, UK and India. 4.1M of these migrants is female. Canada also has the highest number of "work migrants" (as of 2016) - 69.7 thousand - even more than the United States for the same year.

The [raw data](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates17.shtml) for much of this is made available by the UN.
