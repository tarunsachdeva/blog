Aaron Swartz was a [young pioneer of the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M85UvH0TRPc). His work in his early _teens_ still shapes how parts of the web works today.

Today, I stumbled across his old blog - which has been taken down but luckily maintained through Archive.org.

He has a series called [Raw Nerve](http://archive.is/8uu5x), a series of pieces on "getting better at life", as he describes. One particular post, [Believe you can Change](https://archive.is/u7t8x), is an excellent commentary on the concept and application of [Growth Mindset](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/index.html) by Carol Dweck. 

It's an excellent post and one that I'll probably come back to often.
