This is post 75, and marks 75 consecutive days of blogging. 

Some reflections on building this habit:

* Mood changes really impact my will to write everyday. Some days all I can muster is an interesting link and some short commentary. You can't even call that writing - it's just a tweet.
* Related to above, fighting the urge to give up on those days is difficult, but it's extremely satisfying to keep a streak going. The pull to maintain a streak is essential to habit forming.
* I've learned a lot about what I enjoy writing about, what comes naturally, and what takes a while but is really satisfying to complete. It's taught me a little bit about myself.
* Consistent timing is essential. I've settled into writing before bed, although I do want to experiment with early morning journaling and mid-day writing sessions too.
