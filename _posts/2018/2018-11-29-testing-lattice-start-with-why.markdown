Start with Why is a book by Simon Sinek, published in 2009. There's also an excellent [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) on the subject of the book. It is centered around the concept of "Why" - the central reason that inspires action in people. 

Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Action, is divided into 4 parts:

1) About Why - An overview of "Why" and it's role in decision making
2) Brands - How "Why" plays a key role is helping to shape the long-term success of brands - Lessons from here apply in the Application domain.
3) Organizations - How "Why" plays a role in attracting and retaining employees - Lessons from this section apply mostly in the Individual domain, but some also in the domain of Organization.
4) Personal leadership - How "Why" plays a role in leadership - This is primarily concerned with how leaders use Why as a tool to inspire and lead - and can be considered part of the Individual or Organization domain. 

As a leadership book, Start with Why touches many parts of the lattice, and is one of the few books that bridges between the domain of Individual, Organization _and_ Application / . The lessons test the structure of the lattice, and it's an interesting leadership book structured entirely around the concept of why, rather than a specific leadership technique or management approach.
