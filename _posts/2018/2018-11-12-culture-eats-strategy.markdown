It's often said that "Culture eats Strategy for breakfast." 

I was thinking about this phrase today, and what it really means. 

Strategy is about navigating a specific market landscape. Culture is building an organization that can navigate any changing landscape. 

Strategy is about understanding your market and  competitors. Culture is about focusing on your customers and above everyone else. 

Strategy is making the right choice at the right time, culture is building an organization that knows how to make good choices and learns from them. 

In essence, good strategy is the application of culture. Good culture creates good strategy; the reverse is not true.

I like the phrase but I don't like how it can be misinterpreted.
