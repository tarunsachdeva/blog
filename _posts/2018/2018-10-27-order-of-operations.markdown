Order of operations is a simple concept - it emphasizes that outcomes depend on the sequence in which you do things. You cannot combine the same elements in a different order and expect the same output. 

It's one of the first concepts taught in [elementary arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations). 

It's also a mental model that has broad applications, especially in business. For example, the same product in the same market at two different times will have different consequences. Also, optimizing for product distribution before you have product-market fit can have disastrous consequences. The order in which you do things _matters_ (a lot). It's not enough just to have the right products in market - you have to build the right products for the right people at the right time. 

Leveraging order of operations is the domain of good strategy. Applying the concept creates focus in a team, and it can make the difference between success and failure in products.
