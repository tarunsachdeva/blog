I've been dealing with a lot of uncertainty recently (partially why my posts have been so short in the last few days) - and came across this great book - [How to Fight a Hydra](https://joshkaufman.net/how-to-fight-a-hydra/). 

It's a short read but really well written about the challenges of venturing into the unknown.
