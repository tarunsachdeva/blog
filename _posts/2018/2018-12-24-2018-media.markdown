Some of the best media I've come across in 2018: books, music, TV shows, podcasts - all of these things I've recommended multiple times. This is a running list and will be updating as I remember more.

Books I read and recommended:
- [Atomic Habits](www.atomichabits.com) by James Clear - A great framework for creating lasting behavioural changes ([my review]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-22-atomic-habits-review %}))
- [The 5th Discipline](https://amzn.to/2RdSCno) by Peter Senge - about building teams that improve through continual learning. Not a new book, but one I disccovered this year. Recommended multiple times.
- [High Growth Handbook](https://amzn.to/2CyaL7o), [Blitzscaling](https://amzn.to/2CyaL7o) and [The Messy Middle](https://amzn.to/2CwlaAm) - All three books are about growing a company in the "1 to n" phase.
- [It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work](https://amzn.to/2RgTEPx) - The antidote to the previous three books. A sober take on company building - not found much in tech. 
- [Seeking Wisdom](https://amzn.to/2Ru0T6Y) from Darwin to Munger - Full of lessons and insights about life and work

Music I played on repeat:
- This incredible [Black Thought freestyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prmQgSpV3fA)
- [Enter the Marauders](https://soundcloud.com/djfilthyrich/a-clan-called-wu-enter-the-marauders) - a Wu-Tang / Tribe mix by DJ Filthy Rich
- [NASIR](https://amzn.to/2Czq1kp) (Nas)
- [Scorpion](https://amzn.to/2BIqv5N) (Drake)
- [November](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txZVJ24UVUs) (SiR)
- [KTSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21njPEhEutQ) (Teyana Taylor)

Websites I found and frequented:
- [Farnam Street](www.fs.blog) (Blog) and the associated podcast, [The Knowledge Project](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/)
- I spent too much time on the short term news cycle and found myself going directly to news sources - CNN, Bloomberg, Axios, CNBC, even Fox News instead of through social media.
