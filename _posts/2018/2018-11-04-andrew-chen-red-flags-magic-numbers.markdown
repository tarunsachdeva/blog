Recently Andrew Chen [published](https://andrewchen.co/investor-metrics-deck/) an investor metrics deck - a way to look at startup growth as an investor based on his many years of writing, speaking and teaching on the topic. It's an excellent resource that I'll refer back to later, much like many of Andrew's now infamous essays. This deck is a great summary of how he transitioned his learnings from being an operator to an investor.
