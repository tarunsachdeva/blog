A short post today. 

I spent Christmas day with family. My wife and two new daughters, as well as in-laws, uncles, aunts and cousins. Right now, I'm feeling very fortunate.

I'm also thinking about the year ahead. There's a so much to look forward to - and a lot of uncertainty as well. I'm looking forward to writing more about that in the next few days.
