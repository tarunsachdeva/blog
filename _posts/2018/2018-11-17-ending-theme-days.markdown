When I first started this blog, I thought it would be easier to start writing by picking a theme for everyday. I've found that practice to be cumbersome and is taking the fun out of the experience- so I'm stopping it. I May choose to restart it at some point but for now, I'm going to write about what I feel rather than some arbitrary schedule I've created. Let's hope this free flow helps the writing process.
