The leadership lattice is a learning framework, focused on management and leadership. The framework is a simplified conceptual structure of how companies work - and takes inspiration from the world of systems thinking. It's a set of interconnected domains of responsibility - put together, they can describe everything your company does from individual to impact.

I've been testing how well it works as a learning framework by taking lessons from the most popular leadership books and checking how they _fit_ into the lattice. In theory, the lattice is the skeleton and the books provide the "muscle" through specific management practices.

Two books in particular - Lean Startup and Zero to One - provide leadership and management practices for early stage startups. Both these books revealed that the lattice is incomplete because it doesn't have a concept of time. Your leadership lattice (and associated practices) should and will evolve as your company grows in size.

So, I wanted to add the concept of **Stage** as a property of each domain across the lattice. Different stages require different practices and that needs to be reflected in the lattice. The good thing is - the domains themselves (i.e the conceptual strucutre of how companies work) is largely unchanged, no matter what the stage - every stage will have domains for individuals, teams, application, and so on.

Note that the lattice was also extended recently through the addition of the [peer and governance domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-06-extending-the-lattice %}).
