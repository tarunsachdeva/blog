I recently picked up [Atomic Habits](http://www.atomichabits.com) by James Clear. He has been writing an incredible blog for many years about the importance of habits and how to build them. 

In this book, he details the four-step model of habits - cue, craving, response and reward - and the associated Four Laws of Behavioural Change that create habits.

According to Clear:

> The framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.

I just got started - It's a great book already. I'll write a more detailed review in a future post (I don't expect it will be too long from now).
