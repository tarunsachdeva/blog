Today I spent the afternoon watching the Mars Insight mission land on Mars. I wondered what space travel was going to look like when my daughters are my age, and whether we'd see a man or woman on Mars by then.

The New York Times has a great [interactive article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/25/science/insight-how-to-land-on-mars.html) on the mission, with some excellent images of the craft and landing routine.
