I've been writing about the leadership lattice for a while, and it's mostly been in theory. I'm going to start putting it to the test by seeing how some of the top leadership resources fit into the lattice. If the lattice "works", it should be expansive enough to hold management advice from a number of sources. I'm also hoping to see how it breaks and where it can be extended.

Over the next few weeks, I'll start with some of the leadership books that are popular in the startup community:

- High Output Management by Andy Grove
- The Hard Things about Hard Things by Ben Horowitz
- The Lean Startup by Eric Ries
- Zero to One by Peter Thiel
- The Innovators Dilemma by Clayton Christensen
- Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore
- Good to Great by James C. Collins
- The Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge
- Effective Executive by Peter Drucker
- Start with Why by Simon Sinek
- Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni
- Radical Candor by Kim Scott

I'll be collecting the data from this analysis [in a Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_b6q-XxuldiAuRPUSapd_P9oe0a6WQZh8HkaNhlKXb0/edit#gid=0), but will also link to it from the blog.
