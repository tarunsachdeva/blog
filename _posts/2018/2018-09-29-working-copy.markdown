[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) is a very powerful, fully featured Git Client for iOS.

I use Working Copy to edit this blog on my phone. Because this blog is also a git repository, I can edit content and code. I just commit and push any changes to my Github repository and see them live.

Making huge changes on mobile isn't recommended because there's no way to test on a local environment first, but there's something really powerful about being able to make code changes on the go. I admit it's not the most user friendly blogging solution, but one that works well for me. I like the control and flexibility of blogging on Github pages, and the freedom of doing things on the go using Working Copy.

Working copy can be downloaded on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8&uo=6&at=1000lHq&ct=workingcopyapp).
