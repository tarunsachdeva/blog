It's been hard to ignore the news this week, which ended with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. 

It's been a frustrating, infuriating and tiring presidency, but this change is particularly bad because it lasts even when Trump leaves office.

I'm super disappointed to see this happen to the justice system in the US. 

Go vote in November.
