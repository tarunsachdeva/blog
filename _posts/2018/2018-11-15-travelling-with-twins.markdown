Today was the first time we travelled on a plane with our twins. A relatively short flight - Toronto to Orlando, but a lot of preparation and a few surprises along the way. We're here now and escaped the Toronto snow just as it started falling. Looking forward to writing in the sunshine over the next few weeks.
