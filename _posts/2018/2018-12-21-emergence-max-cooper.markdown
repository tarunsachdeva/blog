[Emergence](http://emergence.maxcooper.net/) is an audio visual project created by Max Cooper and a number of collaborators, exploring the natural world, humans and technology.

> Emergence is the story of natural laws and processes, their inherent beauty, and their action to yield the universe, us and the world we live in.

The videos and sounds are absolutely stunning. One of my favorites is [Adaptation](https://vimeo.com/196269431).
