I saw this phrase on Twitter today - it was a quote from Sheetal Jaitly, CEO of TribalScale, an innovation consulting firm in Toronto. I think he was referring to most companies' innovation labs and hackathons - which are simply theatrics that serve no real purpose other than to make leaders _feel_ like they're 
innovating.

My hypothesis is that **innovation teams should aim to not exist**. Essentially, they should aim to lose the "innovation" prefix. In order for an innovation team to succeed, they have to graduate to being a part of the business. True innovation teams become business lines that create new customers and value networks. 

After all, innovation teams inherently have a limited life span - if they cannot prove their value within the cadence of a strategic planning cycle, they will often cease to exist anyways - but for the wrong reason. 

True innovation teams create real business value. Everything else is just innovation theater.
