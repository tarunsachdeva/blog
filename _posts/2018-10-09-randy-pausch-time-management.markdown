Dr. Randy Pausch, best known for ["Last Lecture"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Lecture), fittingly had some some timeless advice on time management and shared it in an incredible lecture.

Ofcourse, the Last Lecture is a classic presentation on the value of time and has been turned into a New York Times best selling book.

His thoughtfulness about the value of every minute reminded me of a similar talk I saw at TEDxToronto by Jeremie Saunders - the co-founder of the Sickboy Podcast, who has been diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis since childhood. He has an incredible story and beautiful perspective on life.
