Li Jin recently published [16 Key Metrics for the Passion Economy](https://a16z.com/2020/01/08/key-metrics-for-the-passion-economy/), in which she outlined the various measures of success of startups in the space. 

The first group focuses on the primary success metrics of the creators themselves - how well they are moving through the funnel. These include per creator metrics (% free supporters to becoming paid), to aggregrate views of their ecosystem (% creators have reached a certain threshold). 

Each creator is a business, so they have to look at the growth of their business (typically through engagement metrics) and the revenue that audience is driving. There are also a number of interesting metrics to measure organic growth and network effects.

Now that every creator is being given the tools that many startups didn't even have a decade ago, we can probably expect an massive increase in demand for skills that help software-powered businesses grow.
