I'm starting a small side project. 

I've always been interested in our relationship with software, and how this abstract material has come to make us feel more productive and connected to each other. I want to explore a specific dimension further - how software can be used to promote a deeper understanding of one self and others. 

I'm going to start my exploration in the workplace. Today, knowledge workers realize more than ever the necessity and power of strong relationships - especially within a working environment. They create high performing teams. They build better products. They drive results. And above all, they make it enjoyable to come to work. 

I'm not sure what direction this will take, but I'll share more details as this exploration continues.
