I came across this short video from Edutopia today on the importance of inclusivity in classrooms. In tech, we discuss inclusivity as an important way to build better products. It makes sense that the same thinking has been true in pedagogy - the study of teaching and learning - for many years. Check out the video [here](https://www.edutopia.org/video/building-belonging-classroom), and some key excerpts I took from it:

> [The classroom] community becomes a place where you can bring your emotions, fears, needs, and be honest about what's going on. And know there will be acceptance and support and love that's available to carry you through.

> Sense of belonging is one of the most important activators of a child’s engagement in learning. Everything about activating a child’s cognitive skills begins with activating their social connectedness.
