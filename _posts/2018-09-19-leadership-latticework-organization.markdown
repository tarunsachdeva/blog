The second layer of the Leadership Lattice is the Organization domain, and is about the managing the structures and systems of people organization.

The concerns here on a wide spectrum based on size - from building cohesion within a single team to organizing business units across a larger organization. There are some shared problems across this spectrum but as a company scales, the frameworks are very different. 

This part of the lattice is one of the most dynamic - team structures are constantly shifting, individuals move between teams

* A guiding mental model I've found helpful is that of _Organizational Flow_. When we do things right to build and align teams in the right way, the organization structures become invisible and we can reach a collective ["flow" state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology). On an individual level this is defined as "the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment". Getting to this state requires the active practices of alignment, thoughtful organization, conflict resolution - all which are key to this part of the lattice. How this is achieved looks very different in a team vs. a large organization, but ultimately we just want our organizational structures to _work_. When they do, we're in a flow state. 

* In getting to this states, these are some of the practices I've found:

	* Building Organization Structures
	* Managing Resource Allocations
	* Managing Leadership Teams
	* Managing a Team Lifecycle
	* Setting Roles and Responsibilities + Creating Autonomy 
	* Importance of Building Diverse and Inclusive Teams
	* Setting Good Team Practices
	* Team Culture and Values
	* Building Team Cohesion
	* Conflict Resolution
	* Effective Communication and Dialog
	* Building Cohesion Between Teams
	* Change Management

* Some Frameworks used to manage some of the practices above (a very incomplete list for now): 

	* Org Structures: [Types of Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure#Types), [Squad Framework](https://medium.com/productmanagement101/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761) 
	* Team Lifecycle: [Tuckman Stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)
	* Conflict Resolution: 
	* Culture and Values: Lots of examples, most famous one is [Netflix](https://www.evolutionpartners.com.au/netflix-core-values-and-culture-statement-a-core-values-example.html)
	* Cohesion Between Teams: [Amazon "Team API" Structure](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~mtov/pmcc/modularization.pdf)
