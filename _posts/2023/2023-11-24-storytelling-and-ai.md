I worked at Wattpad for almost 8 years and we saw first hand how readers and writers created community around narratives and fandoms. Like others, I've been observing, tinkering and exploring the possibility space for generative storytelling. I can say with confidence that generative AI will completely transform what it means to create and consume stories. 

Letâ€™s consider discovery and consumption. Finding a story today is a process of discovery among millions of titles, made easier with machine learning. AI makes it possible to craft the narrative we want on the fly. We go from finding a story to read from a finite set of possible options, to **creating the the story you want to read**.

Fan interactions will be transformed too. Instead of merely discussing stories within fandoms, AI will lets us also **talk directly with the characters** in a story. Its a brand new type of interaction not possible before - something storytellers have to go to great lengths to mimic today.

The most exciting part is the creative experience. Today, writers craft tales for an audience to enjoy. With AI, they go from writing an individual storyline, to **creating an entire story world**, inviting readers to play and create their own narratives. This elevates their role as creators into _world-builders_. 

There's a lot of talk about AI taking away from artists' control, but when you look at AI's role in storytelling, it's actually enhancing the creator's influence. By opening up new avenues for interaction and creativity, AI isn't replacing the artist; it's expanding what it means to create.
