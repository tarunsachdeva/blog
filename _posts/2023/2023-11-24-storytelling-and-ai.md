I worked at Wattpad for almost 8 years and saw first hand how communities formed around narratives and fandoms. Like many others, I've been observing and tinkering with generative AI over the past few months. Even in its current form, its pretty clear AI will transform how we create and consume stories.

Letâ€™s consider discovery and consumption. Finding media today is a process of discovery among millions of titles. This is made possible with machine learning on large amounts of user consumption data. AI now makes that discovery process almost unnecessary - you can craft a narrative _on the fly_. We can (and I predict _will_) go from finding stories from a finite (albeit large) catalog, to simply **reading / watching the the stories you want**. This changes the role of a consumer into a far more interactive role. This will also necessitate brand new economic structures for content.

Fan interactions will be transformed too. Instead of merely discussing stories within fandoms, AI will let us also **interact directly with the characters** in a story. One could argue this isn't _new_ - roleplay is an established mechanism of fan fiction. What's new is fans can now "talk to characters" from their favorite fandoms, in high fidelity, in depth, and on demand. Infact, you don't even have to find a fandom - you can just go straight to the characters themselves!

The most exciting part is the creative experience. Today, writers craft tales for an audience to enjoy. With AI, they go from writing an individual storyline, to **creating an entire story world**, inviting readers to play and create their own narratives. This elevates their role as creators into _world-builders_. 

There's a lot of talk about AI taking away from artists' control, but when you look at AI's role in storytelling, it's actually enhancing the creator's influence. By opening up new avenues for interaction and creativity, AI isn't replacing the artist; it's expanding what it means to create.
