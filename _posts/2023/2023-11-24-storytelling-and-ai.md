Generative AI is shifting how we interact with the tradition of storytelling. I worked at Wattpad for almost 8 years and we saw first hand how readers and writers created community around narratives and niches. AI completely changes the calculus for both consumers and creators in many ways. 

Letâ€™s consider discovery and consumption. Finding a story is a process of discovery among millions of titles, made easier with machine learning. AI  makes it possible to craft the narrative we want on the fly. You can read the story you want rather than the one presented to you. 

Fan interactions have transformed too. Instead of merely discussing stories with other fans, AI now lets us engage directly with the characters directly.  Its a brand new type of interaction not possible before. 

Creating stories has also seen a change. Writers once crafted tales for an audience to enjoy. With AI, creation is a collaborative process, inviting readers into the very heart of narrative creation, where they can influence the story's direction.

There's a lot of talk about AI taking away from artists' control, but when you look at AI's role in storytelling, it's actually enhancing the creator's influence. By opening up new avenues for interaction and creativity, AI isn't replacing the artist; it's expanding what it means to create.
