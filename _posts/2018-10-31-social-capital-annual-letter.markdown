Today I'm reading the [annual letter](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/socialcapital-annual-letters/Social+Capital+Interim+Annual+Letter,+2018.pdf) from Social Capital - the somewhat controversial venture firm started by Chamath Palihapitiya. 

A lot of interesting commentary on the state of VC, new investible technology trends, and how Social Capital operates as an independent technology company.
