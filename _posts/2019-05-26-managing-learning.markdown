This post is an unstructured set of notes.

I've become interested in understanding how the best companies think about managing the learning infrastructures in their organizations.

This includes:
- How employees are given learning opportunities for personal growth
- How teams are provided the tools to continuously learn and get better
- How the feedback loops from markets help a team evolve a product

That last point is arguably just the domain of product management. For the first two - I'm not sure if there's an obvious market leader. Learning Management Systems aren't new, but they seem like an overly heavy solution. Since learning is so individually driven, there feels like there's space in a market for an LMS with a Slack-like distribution model - driven by employees but ultimately paid for by the company.
