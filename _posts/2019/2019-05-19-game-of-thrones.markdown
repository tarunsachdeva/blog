After 8 seasons, Game of Thrones is over. It was the most successful show in television history. Some facts from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones):

- The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.
- The series has received 47 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, and 2018.
- The first season averaged 9.3 million viewers per episode. By season 7 it was 32.8 million. Season 8 numbers aren't out yet but I wouldn't be surprised if it touched 40M or more. 

GoT was a cultural phenomenon by all measures. It's the kind of story universe that can turn into books, TV shows, movies and amusement parks. The show might be done but I don't think we're done with these characters just yet.
