Recently, Stripe published a blog post about accessible color systems - something most companies would not pay much attention to.

But, this wasn't just _any_ post on accessibility or design systems, it was a first principles breakdown of the problem and an incredibly thorough investigation of the best approach. Read it [here](https://stripe.com/au/blog/accessible-color-systems).

The content itself is interesting, but the real story is the level of investigation into the topic. It's another one of the reasons I believe Stripe is one of those once-in-a-generation type of companies.
