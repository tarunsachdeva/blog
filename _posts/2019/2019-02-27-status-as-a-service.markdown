Eugene Wei wrote one of the best blog posts I've  read called [Status as a Service](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service). 

There's so much here - the nature of status in social networks, how ICO's and social networks are similar, how Facebook copying social apps creates context collapse... too much to summarize right now. 

I'll come back to this post with a summary of my takeaways, but for now - wow. Hat tip to Eugene Wei for the most thoughtful analysis of social networks I've read in a long time.
