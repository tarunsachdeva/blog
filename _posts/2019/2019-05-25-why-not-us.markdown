The Toronto Raptors made the NBA finals for the first time in it's 25 year history, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks 100-94 in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals. 

There's very little else on my mind. But more than the game, it's this question. Why _not_ us?

Why not Toronto? Why not the Raptors? Why do we carry a collective impostor syndrome that tells us - we're good, but not _good enough_ for that ultimate title. It can feel undeserved; unattainable. It's also bullshit. 

Why not us? There's no reason. It's time to get our mental stigmas out of our own way - and show the world what we're capable of. Let's go, Raptors.
