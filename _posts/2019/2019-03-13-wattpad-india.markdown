Wattpad announced a major partnership today - a strategic investment from Times Bridge, the biggest media company in India. 

This is exciting for a number of reasons.

First - India is the fastest growing internet market, largely driven by recent changes in data prices. Hundreds of millions of Indians are now online, enjoying data services like never before.

India has a very rich and diverse literary tradition, and Wattpad is the perfect place to help it grow. For many years, we've supported over 10 different Indian languages (and over 50 globally), and have seen the growth of subcommunities around Indian stories. This partnership will help accelerate the growth of those communities. 

For our writer community in India, and those looking to reach an Indian audience - this partnership will open opportunities. Wattpad stories in India will turn into books, TV shows, and yes, Bollywood films.

As an Indian turned Canadian citizen, I'm just excited to see Wattpad take off in India.
