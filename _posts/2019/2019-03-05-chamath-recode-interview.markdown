Chamath gave a [doozy](https://www.recode.net/platform/amp/podcasts/2019/3/4/18247010/chamath-palihapitiya-social-capital-happiness-identity-crisis-kara-swisher-teddy-schleifer-podcast) of an interview recently with Kara Swisher on Recode-Decode. So much ground covered - the search for happiness, valley culture and its effect on mental health, toxic masculinity... so much. 

Definitely worth a read and a listen.
