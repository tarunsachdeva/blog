How can we _opt out_ of our data being used to inform machine learning models and algorithms? Is this even possible?

I asked myself this question today and googled "machine unlearning", and got some interesting results.

I'd imagine this to become a much bigger problem over time, especially with the ongoing discussion around data privacy and security.
