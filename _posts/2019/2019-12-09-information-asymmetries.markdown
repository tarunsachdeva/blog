One truth that has become apparent in the last few months is the amount of knowledge asymmetry that exists in so many parts of our lives, from finance to career choices. Some of that asymmetry comes with privelege - those who know are protective of their secretive ways. There is some room to play in the margin but it is not a sustainable advantage. It's a knowledge arbitrage so to speak. 

But the walls are being broken down and any institution or practice that survives entirely on the basis of this is doomed to fail. I think this is an entirely good thing. When more people ask right questions to ask in a negotiation or take advantage of the best investment strategies, the scarce becomes abundant, and we can raise the tide for everyone.
