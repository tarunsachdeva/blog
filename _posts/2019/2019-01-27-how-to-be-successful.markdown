Sam Altman from YCombinator published [some perspectives](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) on how to be successful. 

On one hand it's incredibly useful - a condensed insight into the patterns of people seeking to make a mark in the world. A great guide to company building. 

On another hand, it also feels a bit out of touch. It's a strange time for a leader from Silicon Valley to aggrandize the alpha mentality - focused only on self improvement and trying to outwork each other. Boldness and willfulness created Uber but also took down it's cofounder. 

Success is relative. This post is useful but needs a balanced perspective.
