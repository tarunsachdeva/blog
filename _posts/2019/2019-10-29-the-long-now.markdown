Earlier this year, Ben Hunt from [The Epsilon Theory](https://www.epsilontheory.com/ the-long-now-pt-3-is-this-normal-asking-for-a-friend/) started a series of posts called [The Long Now](https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-long-now-pt-1/). To me, it's a philosophically-inclined commentary on the current state of the US financial system. A call to arms that compells everyone to take control of their financial futures.

> I know that there is no Long Now. The Now is short. That is exactly what makes it precious beyond price. The Now is for LIVING.
> 
> I know that there is no Safe Future. The Future is risky. That is exactly what makes it precious beyond price. The Future is for INVESTING.

His latest in the series, [Is This Normal? Asking For a Friend](https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-long-now-pt-3-is-this-normal-asking-for-a-friend/), questions the social and political abstractions we've been bucketed into, losing all sense of nuance and identity. Life has become deterministic, programmable. 

> That’s the defining characteristic of life in the Long Now … you swim in an ocean of stimulus and fear so long that you forget whether or not there was ever a shore. You forget yourself. You forget your identity as an autonomous human-in-full, connected with other humans that you work and play with in a non-instrumental sense. You forget your Pack.

You have to adopt an open mindset to really enjoy this series. But once you're there - it's some of the best writing I've read in a while.
