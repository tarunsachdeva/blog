On August 27, 2018 - exactly 16 months ago - I started a daily writing habit. This last year has been the first full calendar year of writing everyday. I explored a number of topics this year, from the role software in society to how decentralization happens in marketplaces. Most of these topics were driven by the desire to clarify my thoughts (and learn more) about a certain topic. 

A few of favorite posts from this year (judged by how many times I've referred back to them):

* [Software and Plastic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-05-software-and-plastic %})
* [An Incomplete Professional Network]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-15-incomplete-professional-network %})
* [What's Happening in India]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url _posts/2019-01-13-whats-happening-in-india %})
* [Deep Work and Connected Work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-16-deep-work-connected-work %})
* [The Calendar as a Network and Platform]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-23-calendar-network-platform %})
* [Media and Multidisciplinarity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-21-smartphone-media-second-decade %})
* [Systems of Impact]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-09-systems-of-impact %}) (this was one of many posts that explored systems thinking applied to leadership).
* [Marketplaces, Decentralization, and Losing Trust]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-08-18-marketplaces-decentralization-trust-supply-side %})
* [Question Quality]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-09-19-question-quality %})
* [We Are All Going to Die]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url _posts/2019-10-03-we-are-all-going-to-die %})
* Notes on 'What You Do is Who You Are': [Louverture]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-09-notes-on-louverture %}), [Bushido]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-15-notes-on-bushido %}), [Shaka Senghor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-16-notes-on-senghor %}),[Genghis Khan]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-17-notes-on-genghis-khan %})
* [Forces at Play and Base Rates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-21-forces-at-play-base-rates %})

This habit has become a central part of my daily system, and I'm looking forward to learning more through writing in the years to come.
