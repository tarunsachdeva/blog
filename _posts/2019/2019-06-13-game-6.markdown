2 minutes left in the 3rd. We could be one quarter away from a championship. I don't know. 

I can barely think straight and wanted to capture this moment. Half of me wants to scream; the other half just wants to take a nap.

That's it for now.

UPDATE: We won. Going to scream in the streets for a few hours.
