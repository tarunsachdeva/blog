Anthony Pompliano aka "Pomp" is a crypto investor and author of the prolific Off the Chain Substack and podcast. He recently wrote a post entitle [The Machines will Run the Financial World](https://offthechain.substack.com/p/the-machines-will-run-the-financial) about how all assets are being tokenized into currencies (many through blockchain but not all). This enables quicker transactions, T0 settlement times and a market that never closes. These efficiencies will change every asset class:

> I anticipate that the entire financial system will ultimately be automated. So while I consistently talk about Bitcoin and a decentralized digital currency, it is important to remember that the same disruption happening to money will happen to stocks, bonds, and commodities.

It's a great read.
