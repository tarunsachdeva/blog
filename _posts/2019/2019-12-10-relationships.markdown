Nothing matters more than the relationships. 

If you’ve worked with me you’ve probably heard me emphasize this point. This is especially true for startups where risk of failure is higher than other companies. But it’s a universal rule no matter the size of the company. Good relationships with your coworkers makes all the difference in tough situations. And ultimately, when the intersections in our career journeys ends, it's the relationships that are left.

But it applies elsewhere too. Good relationships with partners makes it easier to resolve unforeseen circumstances. And the same for customers - when you launch something and it doesn't go as planned, maintaining trust with your community can save the day.
