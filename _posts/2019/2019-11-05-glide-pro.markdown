Today Glide announced it’s Pro Plan. Glide allows you to create a progressive web app using Google Sheets as an API. Somewhat similar in spirit to [PostGrest]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-02-postgrest %}), Glide provides pre-built components on top of existing data, allowing you to build apps by putting components together in a visual way (for PostGrest that "component" is just a RESTful API on a database). Those components can be as simple as CRUD functionality, but also adds capabilities like payment and maps. 

Glide has been popular in the no-code movement since it’s launch, but the Pro Plan allows for more data, support for docs in shared drives, custom branding, and more. I can expect more entrepreneurs using Glide Pro as a primary way of launching and testing products quickly, which is good for consumers and creators alike.
