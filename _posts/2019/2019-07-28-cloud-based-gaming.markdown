This post is set of notes from [great article](https://redef.com/original/how-cloud-gaming-will-and-wont-disrupt) about the promise of cloud gaming.

> Cloud gaming is the new “thing” in the media industry. Whether it’s a game publisher or platform, there’s constant talk and even more ambition to be the so-called “Netflix of gaming”. 

On Gaming's reliance on technology platforms:
> This reliance has several interconnected consequences. First, gaming is more powerfully influenced by technology (and therefore technology change) than other categories. Put another way, business models and content flow more strongly from tech than to technology. Evidence of this is abundant; regardless of whether content or distribution is king, making games under the wrong technological premises will always come back to haunt you.

On how new gaming platforms are not zero sum, vs. other forms of media like music.
