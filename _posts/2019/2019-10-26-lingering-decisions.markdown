This last week was consuming by lingering decisions. Some larger than others, but the most common were decisions I've been putting off for a few weeks. Startup life is filled with these decisions. In isolation they look relatively banal, even harmless. Delayed email responses, product features left unprioritized, approvals left unchecked.

But the output of knowledge organizations often starts with decisions, and decision-delay can quickly compounds out of control. 

I'm going to try something new next week - an intentional daily habit to clear my personal backlog of micro-decisions. These can be work related, or personal tasks that I've been putting off as unimportant. Let's see how it goes; I'm looking forward to seeing what I learn.
