Frank Chen from A16Z posted a summary of a talk he gave recently called [Humanity and AI: Better Together](https://a16z.com/2019/02/22/humanity-ai-better-together/). The post (and the [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=3urMxDJbJhI)) is a great primer on the range of development happening in machine learning.
