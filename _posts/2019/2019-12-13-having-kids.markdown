Paul Graham recently wrote a very personal piece about [having kids](http://paulgraham.com/kids.html). 

> ...One of the great things about having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be doing.

For me kids forced a self reflection into my own identity. Probably triggered when I realized these two people are now looking upto me as an example of how to live. Kids also awoke this innate curiousity about the world. When someone sees a plant, a shape, or a color for the first time, it makes you think about how they will perceive and remember that thing. 

Kids create some inexpressible feelings that I'm still navigating. One day I hope to fully put them into words.
