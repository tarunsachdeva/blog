A friend said to me recently, "there are only two modes in life: hard work and hard choices."

Hard work is about focus, consistency, and discipline. Work that compounds on the past. 

Hard choice is about divergence, perspective, and reflection. It guides the direction of hard work.

It's funny to think of life in such simple terms. But sometimes, that's just what you need to cut through all the nonsense.
