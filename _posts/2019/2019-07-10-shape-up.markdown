Another book from the crew at Basecamp - this one called [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/), and details their development process with illustrations. They introduced some concepts in [It doesn't have to be crazy at work](https://basecamp.com/books/calm), especially that of the 6-week project limit. I would call this the most _Rails_ approach to project management - eschewing complexity and reinforcing simple conventions in process. 

It's a quick and impactful read.
