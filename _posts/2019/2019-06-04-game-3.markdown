Game 3 was a resounding victory for the Raptors. The Warriors team just didn't do enough to stop our offensive depth, and wasn't able to find the offensive rhythm as a group to keep pace. Curry had a personal playoff record 47 points, but that isn't important anymore.

I'm excited Toronto won, ofcourse. But I also can't get over just _how_ Golden State lost. This game really brought out the true colors of the fanbase. From Warriors Owner Mark Stevens pushing Lowry for no reason when he fell into the sidelines, to fans streaming out 3 minutes before the end of the game. 

It just makes me appreciate how we support this Raptors team, and how our fans have become a critical part of the franchise.
