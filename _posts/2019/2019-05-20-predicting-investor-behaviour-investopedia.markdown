A really cool talk from the CEO of Investopedia about how they are able to predict market trends based on search behaviour. They created an Investopedia Anxiety Index similar to the VIX. It highlights a few things:

* Most investors are newbies and rely on sites like Investopedia regularly
* Most investors over follow the market and make short term decisions for quick rewards (not a good move)
* Understanding investor intent is the strongest leading indicator of investment. Investopedia is a great source of this information.
