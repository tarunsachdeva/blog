Toronto and Canada hosts its first NBA finals today. The first time the Canadian National anthem will be played during the finals. 

There's so much energy in the city. Sports does such a great job to set aside differences and bring people together. Toronto is already a friendly city but it feels like we're really banding together to celebrate this, and to recognize our own greatness. 

It's an amazing vibe. I can't wait.
