The weather has finally turned a corner. The sun is shining in Toronto after the longest winter in recent history (this might not be true but it really felt like it). 

So much changes when the sun is out. Optimism abounds. Problems solve themselves. A simple walk can change everything.

Like many others, I'm feeling thankful and looking forward to the summer.
