Every year, the Ministry of Immigration releases an [annual report](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/annual-report-parliament-immigration-2018/report.html) to Parliament on immigration. It's a comprehensive report to understand what the ministry is planning for the next few years. This year the government is planning ahead in a 3-year horizon vs single. 

Some higlights from the Minister's letter this year:

> With this in mind, Canada welcomed more than 286,000 permanent residents in 2017. Over half were admitted under Economic Class programs. The number also included over 44,000 resettled refugees, protected persons and people admitted under humanitarian, compassionate and public policy considerations.
> 
> Also in 2017, the Government of Canada adopted a historic multi-year levels plan to responsibly grow our annual immigration levels to 340,000 by 2020, with 60 percent of the growth in the Economic Class. Growing immigration levels, particularly in the Economic Class, will help us sustain our labour force, support economic growth and spur innovation.

This table breaks it down:

It's great to see that this government responding positively especially in light of what's happening in the US. Immigration is essential to our economy and social fabric. 

There is a lot we are doing right but also plenty of room for improvement. The physical and cultural shift as an immigrant is not easy. Add to that the most common _new_ immigrant issues -  language barriers, employment issues and trouble finding housing - and it becomes especially difficult. These are issues that affect all Canadians but are pronounced in the first months and years of a life move.
