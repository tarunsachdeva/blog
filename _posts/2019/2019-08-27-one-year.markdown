Today, one year ago, I [started a habit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-27-starting-a-new-habit %}) of writing [almost] everyday. This is post number 345. 

I've learned a lot about the topics I've explored, and a little about myself. What has surprised me is how useful this artifact has become in daily conversation.

Some of my favorite posts have been about leadership, societal trends, mental models, productivity, and investing. 

I love writing here. It's slowly becoming a stronger part of my identity, and I intend to continue for a while.
