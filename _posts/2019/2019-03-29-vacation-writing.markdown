My writing habit hasn't been consistent over the last few weeks. I average a post a day, but they coming in spurts. I need to work on consistency and timing the habit. Still some work to do, but I'm pushing through.

For the next few days I'll be on vacation in Belize. A nice change of pace but I'm not really sure what that means for the writing. I'd like to stay away from screens so I'm not sure if I can get a daily post out, but we'll see.
