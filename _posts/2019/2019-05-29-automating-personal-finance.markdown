I recently learned about the concept of "self driving money". Money is one of our most personal assets, and the notion that we will one day leave all big financial decisions to software is really interesting. I think it makes a lot of sense, because so many bad financial decisions were the cause of carelessness, or lack of knowledge.

From [QZ](https://qz.com/1311135/credit-karma-ceo-ken-lin-says-autonomous-money-will-be-here-in-five-years/
):

> Lin thinks “autonomous finance” could come about in the next five or so years. And eventually, all of our most important financial decisions could be automated without asking for permission. After all, do you know the best time to refinance your mortgage (and where to get it)? Your student loan? Your car loan? Me neither.
