What a difference a day makes. Just like that, Kawhi is no longer a Raptor. 

His sober get-it-done demeanor was the most _Canadian_ way to win a championship. It's appropriate that Toronto is having the most _Canadian_ possible response: we're upset, but we're not angry. He wanted to go home. You can't be mad at that. 

Whether or not the backroom stories are true, it really tells of the power of the right phone call. In this case, it was Kawhi's to Durant and then Paul George. 

Asking for what you want is an underappreciated skill in life and business. What sets apart the winners is often they're just a bit more clear about what they want, and aren't afraid to ask for it.
