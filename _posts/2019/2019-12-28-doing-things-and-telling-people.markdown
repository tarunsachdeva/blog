Last year, I [resolved]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-09-2019-do-things-and-tell-more-people %}) to simply 'do things and tell more people'. The goal was to share more in public. I don't think I really accomplished that this year. I stopped after a few weeks of tweeting about my writing. The writing and publishing continued, but I chose to keep it quiet and would bring it up in smaller forums.

I still think it's important to share my writing, but my priority with writing is personal: to clarify thought and increase comprehension. This will continue well into the new year and beyond.

This year, I'm focused on simply layering on more and better habits. Some focused on improving my physical and mental well being (diet is the first focus area), others on improving my family and social life. That's it for now; let's see how it goes.
