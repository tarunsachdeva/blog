Amazon announced it's echo buds recently, creating a low priced Airpods competitor tied to the Alexa ecosystem. The relatively low pricepoint ($130) can skyrocket adoption.

A few months ago I wrote about how we are [getting closer to software]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-29-closer-software %}). While Echobuds aren't novel, it's just another development in bringing software closer to our physical selves. 

I also happened to talk to a student from [The Knowledge Society](https://theksociety.com/), an incubator for some brilliant high school students - who was investigating the world of 3D printed organs, gene editing and CRISPR. This is how software is eating the world from the inside out.

Technologists love to extrapolate potential, but mass adoption is often a multi-decade sport. But at the same time, our future already exists in today's science fiction. It's wild to think about our world in twenty or thirty years.
