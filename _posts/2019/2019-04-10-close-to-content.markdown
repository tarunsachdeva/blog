In online networks designed for sharing content, a general product trend is user interaction always gets _closer_ to the content. Put another way, when users are given the ability to react to something _as they are enjoying it_, it tends to create more engagement. 

Soundcloud's _in-song comments_ let you add comments to a specific place in a song. It's arguably the most unique part of the platform, and often provides quality signals to listeners. 

Reading platforms like Wattpad or Medium provide _inline comments_ that let you comment and highlight what you're reading. 

Youtube lets you add a comment on a specific place in a video (but doesn't highlight these to the viewer, so they are not easy to discover). Periscope and Instagram Live let you add reactions in real time in a very playful floating emoji/hearts experience.

Likes or favorites are often considered "table stakes" for any content community. But when you let audiences leave their mark on their favorite places (in a song, story or whatever), it creates meaningful connection with content - and it's creator.
