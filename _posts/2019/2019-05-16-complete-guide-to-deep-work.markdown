The Doist published an excellent [guide to Deep Work](https://doist.com/blog/complete-guide-to-deep-work/). It explains the concept and provides some real world strategies to create environments of deep work in your day. They focus on intentionality of the structure. In the section about [how to build a deep work routine](https://doist.com/blog/complete-guide-to-deep-work/#Build_a_Deep_Work_Routine), it mentions:

> Practicing intention with your time and considering when youâ€™ll fit in periods of focus is an important part of succeeding with a deep work habit.

The four elements of that are:
- **Location** - A space that's conducive to deep work
- **Duration** - A period of time that works for you (starting small then increasing over time as you build your "deep work muscle")
- **Structure** - The rules for the session - whether its digital distractions or how you will measure success
- **Requirements** - What's required to help create the environment - music, food, etc. This will be learned over time.
