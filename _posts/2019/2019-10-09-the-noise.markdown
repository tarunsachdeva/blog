I had written a short post about Donald Trump and the impeachment saga. I try to ignore daily news, but this was clouding my thinking. The post helped me clear my mind. In an ironic twist, it got deleted in the publish process. 

I decided against rewriting the post. It felt like a strange signal telling me not to bother. Fuck the noise. Onwards.
