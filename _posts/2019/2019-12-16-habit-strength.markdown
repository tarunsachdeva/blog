It’s become clear to me that despite a decent streak of almost 500 posts, my writing habit hasn’t been able to survive a few weeks of very different daily routines. The change has been triggered by travel, some life events and the holiday season. 

But, I still consider writing and this blog to be a central part of my thought process. I’ve missed it and think about it often.

The key here is what James Clear called “anchoring” in his book atomic habits. Writing was previously anchored in the beginning of my workday. I had cleared my schedule in the morning to make space for it. But, a different schedule meant I no longer have that space. 

The solution is to anchor writing to something that happens daily no matter what. Perhaps it’s the first thing I do when I wake up, or right before going to bed. Let’s see - it’s time to strengthen this habit even more.
