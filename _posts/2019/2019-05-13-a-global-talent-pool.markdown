Restricting talent to a local candidate pool isn't a sustainable way to build a company. It's impossible not to look outside a city especially in a competitive hiring environment like today. Remote-only organizations are becoming more common, and companies have to start building cultures where remote workers can thrive.

So what does it mean to do business in a global talent pool? Some considerations:

- Hiring becomes both easier and more difficult. Finding the best people globally means there's greater space for meritocracy vs privelege. But, finding the right person is now the proverbial needle in a haystack. 
- Helping create team dynamics in a global talent pool is extremely difficult. This is a common challenge with remote work. Individuals can feel isolated and teams may not feel as cohesive. 
- There's an additional overhead investment to make remote successful. This can include operational issues like knowledge management.

A global talent pool affects all parts of a company system - there's great potential when it can work, but it won't come without proactive investment. For many, that may be too tough a hurdle.
