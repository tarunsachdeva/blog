Microsoft just made a big [announcement](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2019/03/06/updated-microsoft-store-app-developer-agreement-new-revenue-share/) that it would share 95% of revenue with app developers. This is a massive departure from the 70/30 standard that's been in place for many years on iOS and Android. 

On one hand - this can drive tons of developer interest to the platform, and have the second order impact of driving device sales. On the other hand that game has been played and won already. I'm interested to see how the developer reaction is, but if the comments on Hacker News are any judge, this has people talking.
