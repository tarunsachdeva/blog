I made an angel investment recently in [Blackbox](www.blackboxai.tech). They have built an incredible voice search engine and their demo  blew me away. 

Blackbox is able to take thousands of hours of voice data and tokenize it, and then layered on a semantic search capability. In their demo, they used recorded podcasts, and I was able to ask it questions on the fly like "what do the best VCs look for in their investments?" - and it returned the exact snippets in the podcasts where that was answered. It was incredible and really demonstrates that we're so early in realizing AI's potential. 

Looking forward to supporting their journey.
