It's Saturday night, and for the last few weeks I've been struggling with writing - especially on the weekend, when full time parenting is the most draining.

But, sometimes all it takes is the simple act of opening my laptop and firing up a text editor to overcome the struggle. James Clear talked about this in Atomic Habits in a related section about setting up your environment for desired behaviours. For example, if you want to read everyday at night, when you make up your bed in the morning - place a book or e-reader on your pillow. That simple act of picking up a book can be enough to maintain the habit. 

So this post is a reminder that all it takes is a little bit of effort everyday, and that trigger can start compounding very quickly.
