I just picked up [Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.trilliondollarcoach.com/), the story of Bill Campbell - coach to some of the Valley's best. From what I've read already, there's a lot of insight around people and teams. I'm looking forward to seeing how this fits or breaks the Leadership Lattice.

Here's a short intro to the book:

> Bill Campbell helped to build some of Silicon Valley’s greatest companies -- including Google, Apple, and Intuit -- and to create over a trillion dollars in market value. A former college football player and coach, Bill mentored visionaries such as Steve Jobs, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt and coached dozens of leaders on both coasts. When he passed away in 2016, “the Coach” left behind a legacy of growing companies and successful people, and an abundance of respect, friendship, and love.
> 
> From their vantage points at Google, Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, and Alan Eagle experienced firsthand how Bill developed trusting relationships, fostered personal growth, infused courage, emphasized operational excellence, and identified simmering tensions that inevitably arise in fast-moving environments. To honor their mentor and inspire and teach future generations, they have codified his wisdom in this essential guide.
> 
> Based on interviews with more than eighty people who knew and loved Bill Campbell, Trillion Dollar Coach explains the Coach’s principles and illustrates them with stories from the great companies and people with whom he worked and played. The result is a blueprint for forward-thinking business leaders and managers that will help them create higher-performing and faster-moving teams and companies.
