A short post, but a very substantive resource. 

The [Holloway Guides](https://www.holloway.com/about) are a set of highly informative guides to very complex topics. Many are relevant to the world of startups like equity compensation and raising venture capital. It's a welcome editorial approach these topics; an anti-Medium of sorts.

> We publish fully digital Guides to high-stakes, complex subjects. Our titles and our product are created by experts and designed to improve with community contribution over time.

The first guide is about [equity compensation](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation) and is an excellent resource on the topic.
