I came across this really cool visualization of _all the money in the world._ This was created by [The Money Project](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/).

Some really interesting stats:
- There is approximately $215 trillion of global debt, and 33% of it (70 trillion) was added in the last decade alone
- Crypto is the fastest growing asset class in the world, but is _tiny_ when compared to other things like real estate 
- The derivatives market size is legitimately bonkers

Here's the visualization itself:
