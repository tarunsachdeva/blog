A short meta-post for today. As we close the chapter on the year and decade, I've been thinking about how to commemorate this on the blog. This last 2 years has been very unlike the 8 before it, in large part to this collection of random writing. This small corner of the internet has helped me clarify my thinking in unexpected ways. 

I'll definitely use it to reflect on the most meaningful events from the last 10 or so years. I also want to go through an exercise to evaluate the current state of my life. And of course, use it to clarify my approach towards an increasingly uncertain future.
