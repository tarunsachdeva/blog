In December 2009, I was 28, recently married and had just moved into a new home in Toronto. I was working at Blackberry as a product manager.

Fast forward to 2019, the first decade of being married with two incredible twin girls. We're planning another move (more on that soon), and I've grown in many ways personally and professionally. 

Many things have changed but most drastically is my world view. I have a much deeper understanding of myself and the world around me. Looking back at 2009, I was embarrasingly naive. I'm more optimistic than I was before, but more realistic on how to make change happen. 

It's pretty remarkable what a difference a few years can make.
