Tech Twitter is buzzing about the [Away article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion) today. The militaristic management style is inexcusable. What's happening on Twitter is a bit gross too. Not sure there's any better way to change behaviour like this without shining a big bright light though. Company building is not easy - but its a responsibility founders _volunteer_ to take on. This will likely have some very positive intended consequences for employees at Away but I fear about the unintended negative effects too.
