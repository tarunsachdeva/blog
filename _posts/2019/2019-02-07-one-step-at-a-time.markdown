Someone in our family recently passed away. I've been thinking about a lot of things. Writing definitely isn't one of them. 

Death creates immediate perspective.

That said, even if it's a sentence or two - I want to commit to publishing _something_ everyday. 

So this is it today; just a gentle nudge to keep going, and take things as they come. One step at a time.
