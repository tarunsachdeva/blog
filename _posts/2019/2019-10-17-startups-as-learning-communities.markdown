The abstract definition of a "learning community" is a collective of individuals working towards some academic or skill development. Typically, there's a cycle of collaborative and individual work (in academia, class and homework) and a cohort-based structure.

This definition applies well to startups too. The stages of a startup create a natural cohort structure too. Employees often "graduate" out of their roles within 2-3 years, and seek opportunities to learn either in the later stage organization, or elsewhere. 

Startups should consider themselves learning communities with that have a common outcome. After all, in the knowledge economy, the raw ingredients for any startup is people. The most successful startups are known for their business results _and_ their infrastructure for personal growth. This takes intentionality, a good relationship with failure and learning, all of which needs to be supported at leadership level. It's a long term investment.

So much attention about the "Future of Work" goes to the collaboration problems, but there's more unlocked value in solving the higher order problems.
