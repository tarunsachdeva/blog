[Bull and Moon](https://bullandmoon.com/) is a satirical new app that helps you find investment opportunities using your astrological sign. It's a project by [MSCHF](https://mschf.xyz/), which creates products (physical and digital) that are designed to go viral. MSCHF is systemizing this approach with a biweekly drop of two projects. They recently also created [Jesus Shoes](https://jesus.shoes/) - which made over a million dollars in an hour. The consistent drops build anticipation and their projects have been featured on blogs and even late night television. "The Supreme for the Internet generation", as a friend put it recently.

It's amazing to see artists use the Internet as a _native_ medium of expression, vs. just an extension to what they've created already. I love this stuff. This is the best of the Internet.
