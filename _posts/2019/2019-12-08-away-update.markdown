Steph Korey is out at Away, and has been replaced by Lululemon COO Stuart Haselden. Not surprising she left, but this really smells off. The Verge article was a bit strangely timed and structured. John Gruber from Daring Fireball has a [really well written take](https://daringfireball.net/2019/12/away_replaces_ceo) on the whole situation.

> It’s entirely possible that Korey really was responsible for a “toxic work culture”, and the truthful narrative really is “Away fires CEO who created ‘toxic culture’, brings in fresh leadership”. I’m just pointing out it beggars belief that it’s pure coincidence this story leaked to The Verge just before Away was set to fire Korey, such that when the company made the announcement the controversy was still fresh in everyone’s minds.
