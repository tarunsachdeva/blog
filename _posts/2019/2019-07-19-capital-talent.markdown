There's a large disparity between available capital (abundant) and available talent (scarce). Hiring is the biggest challenges for startups today. 

This problem is even more pronounced given there are many more successful companies - more unicorns and IPOs than ever before. 

This is not sustainable and can be resolved by the creation of more qualified talent (through training and development programs). 

It will also serve as a forcing function to build and create high performing productive teams. We are already seeing innovation in ways of managing teams and building products as a result of this. The growth of remote work is a perfect example of this, as is the nocode movement. However there is no single cookie cutter solution yet and it will emerge from the crowd of companies innovating their way around this challenge.
