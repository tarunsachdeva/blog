[AI Superpowers](https://aisuperpowers.com/) is a book by Kai-Fu Lee, Chairman of Sinovation, a Chinese VC firm. 

It's a book about the different stages of AI evolution, from it's role in creating new business models, improving perception of the world, and creating intelligent autonomous robots.

More interesting is the cultural dimension. He posits China will win it all because of the differences in how Chinese companies operate and outcompete it's US rivals. What drives this the _market-driven_ mental model of most founders, vs. _mission-driven_ which is the prevailing model for North American startups. Being market driven means being ruthless about creating any product, copying where necessary, and doing anything to win and establish moats in a market. 

There's likely more nuance in reality, but it's a great read nonetheless.
