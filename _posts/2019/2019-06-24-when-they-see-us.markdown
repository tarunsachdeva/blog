Ava DuVernay's latest work is a 4 part series on Netflix about the Central Park 5. It goes into detail about their experience - on the night of the event, throughout unfair incarceration, and assimilation back into normal society. 

It will grip you, make your blood boil, and make you cry. It is important storytelling. Check it out on Netflix.
