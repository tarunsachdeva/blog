Today, I received a message from a friend asking, "What have you learned from writing on your blog regularly?"

It was a great question that provoked a number of thoughts, and I decided to write out my replies as a blog post itself.

First, writing creates deeper comprehension. Learning and expressing a readable opinion is a great forcing function for understanding any topic. 

Writing also teaches brevity and the art of getting to the point. Infact, writing is more often _removing_ words.

Writing as a habit has taught me about myself - my default systems and common excuses. This is likely the byproduct of a the daily commitment.

Finally, writing has become an instrument to do work. It's not exactly learning, but there's a ton of value here. I often end meetings saying, 'Iâ€™m going to write about this', and that post has lasting value (and a nice reminder of our interaction).
