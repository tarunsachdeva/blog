I've written [before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-23-slack-product-network-ecosystem %}) about my belief in the power of the Slack network, especially with the advent of shared channels (introduced in their first format in 2018). Recently, Stewart Butterfield himself [wrote](https://slackhq.com/shared-channels-growth-innovation) about the power of shared channels with some amazing visualizations that show the growth of shared channels and the nature of that network effect.
