What a shot. Kawhi's buzzer beater capped off an otherwise ugly game of basketball. The fourth quarter was tense. That last point was the most important bucket in Raptors history. Apparently also the first time that's ever happened in a Game 7 of an NBA playoffs.

18 Years ago, Vince Carter was in the same position, against the same team, with the same stakes. He came up short.

There's so much to say about moments like this, but right now it's just a time to _feel_ them. The whole city feels dialed into this. Lots of work ahead but that was an incredible victory.
