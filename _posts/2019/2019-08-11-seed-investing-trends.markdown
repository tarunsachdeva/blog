Tom Tunguz recently shared some [data and insights on seed investing trends](https://tomtunguz.com/which-categories-of-seed-startups-are-thriving-which-aren-t/). 

What's growing: AI, Blockchain, Fintech, Food and Beverage and Software (automating internal processes). 
What's not: Advertising, Analytics, Big Data and Social Media.

This data is a _signal of investor confidence level_ in each of these markets, which is correlated (and sometimes cuasal) to growth in the markets themselves. It's important to understand this abstraction - especially since seed investing sometimes suffers from herd behaviour. For that reason, there's probably an argument to discount the outliers, especially given the [rise in seed funds](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/16/decade-in-review-trends-in-seed-and-early-stage-funding/) over the last few years.
