I started an "MVP" of a gratitude journal. Next to my to-do list for the day, I list 3 things that I'm thankful for that day. 

My weekly plan is on one page, so by the end of the week I had a list 21 things for which I was thankful. It's pretty great to see a list that extensive build so quickly - and a really effective way of showing the power of simple gratitude.

The list is pretty wide ranging. Some days I'm thankful for the love and support of my family, and also for cheesecake. There are no rules!

It's a nice habit to start the day, and hope I can keep it going. And even if not - it's a cool artifact to look back to as a reminder of the many things that are going well.
