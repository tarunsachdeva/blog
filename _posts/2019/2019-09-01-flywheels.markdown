I'm starting another writing project - this one is a newsletter called Flywheels, and I will be hosting it on Substack. Flywheels is a weekly deep dive into a specific company and will analyse makes them grow. I'll cover companies of all sizes.

You can find it [here](https://flywheels.substack.com). I'll post the free content from the newsletter on this blog as well (there will be some paid posts at some point). Subscribe if you're interested!
