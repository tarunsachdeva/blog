I considered taking a day off writing today. I'm not feeling great, so the last thing I want to do is sit in front of a computer and write because of self-created commitment. 

When something is built into a system, it's absence is felt. I immediately regretted the decision and started this post shortly after. Mostly a placeholder for when the feeling returns - which it undoubtedly will.
