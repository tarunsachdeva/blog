What is the value in understanding each other's personalities at work? On the surface, this seems like a stupid question. Ofcourse it's the right thing to do. We're all humans working together, and understanding each other is the best way to work.

But such an obvious problem has such a large and unbounded problem space that it's difficult to know where to start. 

There are products that exist to help us with personality assessments, but most are point in time snapshots. There are hundreds of products to help with workflows but none have the context of our personalities that might help to optimize how things get done. 

This is an area I'm really interested in exploring further. As software moves to higher order problems I imagine more problems of this nature coming to the surface.
