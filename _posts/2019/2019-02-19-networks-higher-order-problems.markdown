There is a trend towards solving _higher order problems_ in consumer and business apps. 

Online networks brought us together, and created connection and space for conversation where there wasn't one before. Those are no longer features that differentiate and create value - the connections and conversations are already on Facebook, WeChat, Twitter, and others. 

Networks of tomorrow will towards building more closely towards the higher order problems. We've created connections but need to do more to enable _understanding_. We've enabled communities but need to do more to create a sense of _belonging_. 

As these new networks emerge, we should be mindful of the lessons in network building that are playing out in public today. We should be creating spaces with intentionality, and an understanding of how they might be misused. That the outcomes could not be anticipated isn't likely an acceptable excuse anymore.
