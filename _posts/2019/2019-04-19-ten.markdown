No lengthy post for today. Tonight I'm celebrating a milestone anniversary with my wife and some of our closest friends. 

There's a lot to be thankful for. We've been surrounded by the love and support of family and friends for almost two decades. I'm excited about everything we've done, but even more for what's ahead.
