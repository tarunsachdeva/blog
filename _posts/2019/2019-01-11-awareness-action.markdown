A short and abstract post about awareness and action.

Companies work like complex systems. Essential to leadership is simply developing greater _awareness_ of the system in which youâ€™re operating, and then an understanding of how to take _action_ on it.

In the context of management - _awareness_ is understanding the people, how they work together, the output of their collaboration, how that is received, and it's broader impact. Awareness is an exercise in listening and learning. 

Awareness is also about understanding your peer group and governance structure, and what they and their organizations need to be successful. Managing anything in an organization requires the ability to influence change in all those directions. Doing so will make you a better citizen of your organization. 

When it's time to take action, the awareness of a company-system helps to create change that has lasting impact.
