Some personal news for the new year.

A few weeks ago I ended the most rewarding chapter of my career at Wattpad, after almost 8 years. There is so much more about the journey than I can reduce into words. I'm filled with overwhelming gratitude - for the incredible relationships, for the challenges we've overcome together, and the space to grow into who I am today.

In a few days, I'll be moving to New York City and starting a role at Endeavor, the entertainment and sports powerhouse, as SVP & GM of Endeavor Education. I can't wait to share more.

I'll be writing about this change, the journey ahead, and reflecting on some lessons from the last few years over the next few days.
