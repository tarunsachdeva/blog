Like many in the world of crypto I've been following the bizarre [story](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/indian-death-certificate-crypto-exchange-quadrigacx-death%3Famp) of QuadrigaCX filing for creditor protection following its founders untimely death. 

I used Quadriga for all my trades but never stored any Crypto in the exchange. Luckily I chose to transfer out as soon as my transactions completed. 

There will likely be more of these types of stories emerging. It goes to show how much work needs to be done to build the public trust in crypto - especially if it's to fulfill its destiny as "Money 2.0".
