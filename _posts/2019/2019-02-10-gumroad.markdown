I remember hearing about [Gumroad](http://www.gumroad.com) and it's founder Sahil Lavingia when Chris Sacca tweeted about him sometime in 2012. At that time, Gumroad was enjoying it's time in the limelight and Sahil was the 19-year-old whiz kid entrepreneur.

He's since gone through an incredible journey and shared it in a lengthy [post](https://medium.com/@shl/reflecting-on-my-failure-to-build-a-billion-dollar-company-b0c31d7db0e7) - it's chock full of insight into the ups and downs of company building.
