Parenting is rewarding, but it's all-consuming. There's no time that's more obvious than the weekend. I've found a really good system to fall back on during the weekday, but weekend schedules tend to devolve pretty quickly. 

Much of it comes down to how the day starts. And the problem with weekends is that they typically start inconsistently, or without any space for personal time. 

Someone mentioned recently they used a morning workout to _anchor their day_. I like that analogy. It implies that it can't swing about wildly, which is what weekends often feel like. By Sunday I'm craving that _routine_ again. Perhaps that ebb and flow is a necessary weekly rhythm. For now, I look for joy by embracing the chaos.
