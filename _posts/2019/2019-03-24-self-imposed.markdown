I had a really good conversation today about how we take ourselves so seriously, and how it creates unnecessary anxiety. 

This happens when we try to become the most productive version of ourselves - and get disappointed when we have an off day. 

This happens when we try to optimize for velocity in our work - and consider the status quo as failure. 

It's also important to note that our goals are self imposed. Most progress happens over  time. A bump in the road becomes easier to manage when seen on a broader time horizon. It's a good time to remind yourself - we often over estimate what we can do in a short time horizon, but under estimate what is possible in a longer one.
