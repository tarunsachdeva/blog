I'm on my way to watch Game 4, and ended up in a wormhole of basketball analysis videos on Youtube.

Here's one I found really interesting - [How The Raptors Became An Elite NBA Team With Only Non-Lottery Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IGwlu7LkKI). I remember each of these events as a fan, and it's really interesting to see how it all strings together into a broader strategy. Perhaps this is just another example of the past seeming so linear and intentional, but it's a cool story nonetheless.
