For the last few weeks, every post has been a struggle to compose. After crossing  185 posts (maybe earlier) I reached the "what's the point?" point. 

I don't know if I can keep writing everyday.

But I'm not sure if this is a real break. I wanted to acknowledge this feeling by, well, putting it in writing. I'm here, asking myself - what are these words adding up to? Why abide so strictly to this self created rule of writing everyday? What's the point of all this? 

Tomorrow, I hope these answers are a bit clearer.
