_Changing_ a habit can sometimes be even more challenging than creating a new one.

The first struggle is simply finding the right time in the morning routine. It helped to plan that in advance (I used an implementation intention described in Atomic Habits by James Clear). The other struggle is getting into the right mental space to start writing at that time. Setting up the environment to write in the morning is difficult (especially with two kids).
