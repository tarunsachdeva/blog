['No Code'](https://www.nocode.tech/) is a movement that enables non-technical entrepreneurs to create real, working digital products. Tools to do this include Shopify, Webflow, Carrd, Glitch and many others. A great starting point for understanding the movement is [Makerpad](https://www.makerpad.co/).

As web and mobile products become easier to build, we're about to see a massive increase in the top of the funnel for new products being created. This inflection means more innovate products in market, but a proportional increase in competition. No code tools are also helping designers and developers collaborate and share common mental models and tools.

It's an exciting wave of growth that can be as powerful as the appstores themselves and will likely create many more digital entrepreneurs along the way.
