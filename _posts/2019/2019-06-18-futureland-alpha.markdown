Futureland is a community of creative self learners, each one committed to a daily practice of publishing something new everyday. 

I've seen Futureland since it's early days and it's a really special corner of the Internet. It's also an incredible learning technique. This blog is an example of one of these projects that started with a commitment to daily writing.
