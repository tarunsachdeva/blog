This blog started in August 2018. It was a way to kickstart a writing habit, and as a much-needed creative output during parental leave.

It's been four months of daily writing; almost 140 posts. 

Posts about everything from productivity, learning frameworks, technology, immigration, mental models, and whatever else comes to mind. This has become a tool for learning, a way to think through ideas, a journal and sometimes just a bookmarking tool.

But I've been pretty quiet about it - choosing not to share except occassionally to close friends. This is a familiar pattern for me, and I'm sure many others too.

I want to start 2019 by reversing that trend. To simply [do things and tell _more_ people]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-07-do-things-and-tell-people %}). So I'm starting here - by telling you what I've been up to for the last few months.

I'm excited about the new year, and hope you are too.
