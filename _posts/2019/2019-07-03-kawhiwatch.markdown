The world was on #KawhiWatch today. I was getting multiple messages full of rumours and hearsay. 

It's pretty insane to see this happening. No athlete in recent memory has gotten this type of attention. It's incredible to be a witness. 

The choice should be  clear. Toronto objectively is a better city for Kawhi. The  chance to defend the championship, a highly competent organization at all level, and cap space to offer upto a 5 year max. That said, we probably need to chill a little bit :)
