I wonder how many new leaders become intimidated by the terms used by leadership teams that are simply abstractions. For example:

* Strategy, which is an abstraction of decision making at a company level
* Culture, an abstraction of the behavioural norms and connective strength of the companies people
* Vision, an abstraction that captures the first and second order effects of everything a company is trying to do.   
* Operations, an abstraction that captures the way in which work happens - the people, processes and infrastructure in place to make things function. 

Abstractions are useful when they simplify something complex to make it more understandable. But new leaders shouldn't confuse [the map for the territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/), and make sure they understand the underlying systems that are being abstracted. Decision making in pure abstract terms can be very dangerous.
