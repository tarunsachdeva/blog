Recently I adopted a new investment strategy for a part of my portfolio, focused on dividend yielding equities. There are a number of common strategies for this - the Dogs of the Dow is probably the most well known.

Here in Canada the equivalent is BTSX - or "Beating the TSX". It was introduced to me by a family member. He successfully used it over the last 2 decades and wrote about it in many finance publications in Canada. To read more about the method, check out the new blog [Dividend Strategy](https://dividendstrategy.ca/stock-selection-method/).

The ideal investing strategy is exactly the opposite:  simple, low-cost, without error-prone predictions about the future.
