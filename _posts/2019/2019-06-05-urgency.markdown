It's 11:50 pm. That gives me 10 minutes to write and publish a post that I haven't even conceived yet.

But for some reason, I'm not worried.

10 minutes is also 600 seconds, a unit shift that adds a different perspective. Some funny math starts to happen - If the fastest person in the world can run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, in 600 seconds they can run 6000 meters. Obviously this isn't true, but the perspective, however flawed, creates abundance from scarcity. This triggers a peace of mind and creates space for focus.

Mental tricks alone aren't enough. A fast approaching deadline is another type of boundary in which creativity can flourish. A boundary that can be manufactured consistently by, well, procrastinating. This is a familiar place - I subconsciously wait for times like this to _force_ creative output.

It would be amazing if I could maintain this pace of output throughout the day. But for now...time's up.
