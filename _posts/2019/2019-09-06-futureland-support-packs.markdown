Futureland is a supportive multidisciplinary community of people committed to creating something _everyday_ for a year. It's [a new way to learn anything](https://hfo.futureland.tv/), and recently launched [Futureland Support Packs](https://internetvin.com/2019/09/06/futureland-support-packs/).

Support Packs are a way to fund the development of the project, which is currently a solo-effort by [InternetVin](http://www.twitter.com/internetvin). He says it best in the [blog post](https://internetvin.com/2019/09/06/futureland-support-packs/).

> Futureland has demonstrated that it can be an effective tool for someone to learn new skills and stick to long term projects. I receive positive feedback on this project every day. But can Futureland continue to sustain itself? At this point, Futureland is entirely created and supported by me. 
>
> I started to wonder, how Futureand could ask for support in a way that (1) was respectful of early user support through their time and energy. And (2) recognizes that Futureland is still very much a product in development and therefore should not be priced like a final product.
>
> The solution I came to was this concept of optional support for existing users. If users want and are in a position to support Futureland, they can. I created a few different methods to do that. Some are simple like a $20 pledge and others include cool products like a limited full-sleeve Futureland tee.
>
> I will always be experimenting with new ways to sustain and expand Futureland while being respectful to its earliest users. The vision is to create a tool that makes it a little easier for any one on Earth to learn anything.
