Lenny Rachitsky just [published](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-to-kickstart-and-scale-a-marketplace) a really interesting resource for entrepreneurs building marketplace businesses. It's a guide that steps through the initial stages (solving the chicken-and-egg problem), scaling and evolving the business. The first part is focused on solving the chicken and egg problem, and he provides a really useful 'cheatsheet' for the process.

This seems like a great resource, with new parts are coming in following weeks.
