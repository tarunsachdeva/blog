Decomposibility was essential to the growth of web technology. The "View Source" feature, which allows you to see how a webpage is rendered (the HTML, CSS and JS), created an entire generation of programmers (myself included).

I wonder if this concept can benefit the world of Machine learning and AI in any way. When a technology becomes simpler to understand, it allows for innovation and ideas to come from more places. This always results in the advancement of the technology itself, but also how it gets applied. 

Some folks seem to be working on the problem of making AI more accessible. A few months ago, Microsoft bought a small AI startup called [Lobe](http://www.lobe.ai). It's goal is to make deep learning accessible to all, and it's product is a visual drag-and-drop tool to train and build deep learning models. 

As ML plays a larger part of our software, I expect the discussion around software decomposibility will too.
