The early days at a startup are great - they are full of optimism and energy. But they also need to be the most focused towards the pursuit of product market fit.

Startups can get caught up in the energy of the start, but very quickly lose focus of their real goal. This happens through excessive fundraising, focusing on external events vs business milestones

What brings everything back on track is _the pursuit of learning_. Startups are nothing more than a hypothesis being tested in market - producing learning. And they are successful - a lot of capital.

Learning habits are especially important for product focused startups. Learning can come through a continual conversation with users, a good habit of looking at the right data at the right time, and being introspective about your learning processes itself.
