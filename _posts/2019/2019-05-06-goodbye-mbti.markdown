I've been reading a lot about this topic as you might have guessed, and came across [this article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/goodbye-to-mbti-the-fad-t_b_3947014) from 2016 by Adam Grant about MBTI's (tl;dr: they're bullshit). The MBTI and other such tests have become standard practice at the majority of Fortune 100 companies, but it's appalling to see how ineffective and downright abusive they can be. 

I love this early stage about learning about anything new. Every fact changes and develops your mental models and creates new dimensions of thinking.
