There has been much discussion on the wealth gap issues in the last few weeks, fueled by speeches on the US campaign trail to Bill Gates' comments on the wealth tax.

I've read a lot of polarizing views on this subject. One side wants all billionaires abolished, and proposes a massive redistribution of wealth. Another side extols the virtues of the free markets as if to say the wealth gap is a feature not a bug. 

I think this is another example of smart people ignoring nuance on both sides. Albert from USV has a moderate and convincing [commentary](https://continuations.com/post/188901476550/bad-takes-on-taxing-wealth-especially) on the same issues.
