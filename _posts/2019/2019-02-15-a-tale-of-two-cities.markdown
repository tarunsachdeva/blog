A very short post today.

There are two similar stories that dominated my feed today. Amazon's [reversal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/nyregion/amazon-hq2-nyc.html) to build HQ2 in New York, and Sidewalk's [leaked plans](https://betakit.com/leaked-documents-reveal-sidewalk-labs-wants-a-lot-more-than-quayside/) to build more than initially stated in it's Quayside proposal. 

I live around the corner from Quayside so that story is particularly alarming. I have no problem with Sidewalk as a concept, but it has created the problems it's facing. Amazon seems to as well, because the whole search was a ridiculous affair. I like Albert Wenger's [take](https://continuations.com/post/182823463265/the-lesson-from-the-amazon-hq2-fiasco).

Technology is a part of our society's fabric. Technology companies cannot operate under their own self made rules and visions. Whether it's through regulation, agency over data, dialogue with the public, or other means - tech companies are responsible for rebuilding this broken trust. This will take years of intentional effort by the entire industry, and the biggest need to lead by example.
