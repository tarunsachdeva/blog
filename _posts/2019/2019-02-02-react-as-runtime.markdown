React is the one of the most popular JavaScript library for creating web and mobile apps.  

It is positioned as a "UI library" to help developers construct user interfaces through _components_. React also provides the ability to store an  application state and update UI accordingly.

It was developed internally at Facebook with contributions from the open source community. [Dan Abramov](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov) is one of those developers at Facebook. 

He's taken the time to write a very thorough developer centric [post](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/) on how React works. I know only enough React to build something simple, but this really helped me understand what is happening under the hood.
