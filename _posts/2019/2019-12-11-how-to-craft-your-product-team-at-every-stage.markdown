I've had the good fortune to be able to chat with Nikhyl a few times, and have always left those conversations with pages full of insight. He recently sat down with First Round and published a piece about [how to craft product teams in different phases of company growth](https://firstround.com/review/how-to-craft-your-product-team-at-every-stage-from-pre-product-market-fit-to-hypergrowth/). It's an excellent and thorough article and I'll be using it as a reference. 

> That’s why Singhal always finds himself dishing out the same piece of advice: **You need to craft a product team to match the phase of your company.** In other words, from the early struggles of finding product/market fit and hiring your first PM, to the “teenage years” of optimizing products in the messy middle and growing to a 10-person product org, to the blistering pace of hypergrowth, every phase of a startup’s life brings a unique set of challenges for the product org.
