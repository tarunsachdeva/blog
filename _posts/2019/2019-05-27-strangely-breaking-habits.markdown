My writing habit is breaking down in a very strange way.

For the last few weeks I've found myself fall into a familiar pattern - skip writing for a few days (or only write a few notes in a draft), and make up for it by writing 3-4 blog posts in one day. I'm not a fan of this intermittence, but also am happy that I'm keeping pace with a single blog post per day _on average_.

The day after writing 3 or 4 posts, I'm tapped out. So I take a break, and the cycle perpetuates.

I'm not sure exactly how to reposition the habit so it can happen more regularly. Mornings are tough because those are my deep work sessions that I like to use. One way I've seen it work is when I can complete a post right before I leave work.

Anyways, I'm not sure how this habit will regularize itself again - but one thing is clear - writing everyday at EOD isn't working that well. I'm hoping to get this fixed soon.
