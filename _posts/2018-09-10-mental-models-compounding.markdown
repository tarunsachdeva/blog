Compound interest (_compounding_) is a powerful force, and one of the most versatile [mental models]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-03-mental-models-monday %}). Compounding "is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit". I like the simpler framing "[growth on your previous growth](https://medium.com/@jaymehoffman/7-mental-models-i-live-my-life-by-e79742d4f074)".

Compounding is versatile. It's a [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) concept that is the foundation for modern finance, but can be applied to almost anything - [knowledge](https://medium.com/@HowieDiamond/compound-knowledge-288292b4503d), capability, ideas, relationships, product growth, and more.

Some sub-concepts about compounding, that can also be applied outside mathematics:

- **You have to have a non-zero starting point.** You cannot compound on nothing. That's obvious with money. To compound knowledge, that includes the basics of whatever field is being studied. In relationships, a base of trust must be first established to build upon over time.
- **Frequency has a massive effect.** Frequency is how often the benefit of compounding is realized, and has a huge effect on the outcome. Allocating time to whatever you _want_ to compound can be achieved by building consistent [habits]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-04-productivity-tuesday-habits %}). Frequency of regular contributions will significantly amplify the effects of compounding.
- **The passage of time is necessary.** Compounding plays out over the long term. In the short term, the incremental gains are hard to notice. You just have to put in the work.

I like this quote from [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103908947263488)
> Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.
