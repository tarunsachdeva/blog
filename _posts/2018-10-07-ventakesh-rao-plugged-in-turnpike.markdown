Another short post today, this one about a recent [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1047925106423603200) by Venkatesh Rao.

In it, Venkatesh argues for building the muscles to stay connected to all streams of information - from the high-latency, live, and lower quality (e.g. the so called "toxic twitter streams") to the low-latency but higher minded (e.g. philosophy books).

He maps the information types on a spectrum in this graph:

I agree with the spirit of it, and believe we do need to adapt ourselves to be able to process the information onslaught instead of taking a "log cabin" approach and retreat towards only higher-order thinking. Also believe there's a natural ebb and flow up and down the "plugged-in turnpike" that the mind will naturally take, and we need to follow it there vs. trying to stop it.

It also requires a level of self awareness about your own learning framework to understanding how your brain best processes information, and act on it proportional to where you are on the turnpike.
