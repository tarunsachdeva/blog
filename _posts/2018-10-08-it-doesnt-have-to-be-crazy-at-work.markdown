Basecamp has always been at the forefront of mythbusting startup norms. They have contributed so much to the startup community - from technology ([Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)), to operating frameworks ([Remote](https://basecamp.com/books/remote)), to lessons on company culture shared over two decades of iteration.

Their most recent book, [It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work](https://basecamp.com/books/calm), is a manifesto for a calmer, more thoughtful approach to company building. Jason Fried and DHH advocate for some seemingly radical ideas - things like no goals or long term plans and encouraging an interruption and meeting-free culture. While it can come across as being a bit dogmatic at times, I appreciate them openly sharing their approach (one that clearly works for them).

It's interesting to have read this today, because just yesterday I [wrote]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-07-ventakesh-rao-plugged-in-turnpike %}) about Venkatesh Rao's thinking about how we need to build a muscle memory for all types of information streams. The approach in this book feels like the antithesis. 

Regardless - it's a quick read, and a refreshing take on company building and culture. Get it [here](https://basecamp.com/books/calm).
