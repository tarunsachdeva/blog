I've been thinking about this topic a lot recently and someone sent me this podcast episode by NPR's [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510308/hidden-brain) on this very topic.

[The episode](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712876949/what-can-a-personality-test-tell-us-about-who-we-are) goes through personality tests of all types - everything from "What Hogwarts house are you" to the MBTI  to chinese horoscopes - and how they have been used and mis-used. Really great listen.
