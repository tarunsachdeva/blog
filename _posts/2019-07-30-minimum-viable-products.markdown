I'll be giving a talk at Ryerson for a product management prep course, covering topics like Minimum Viable Products and Defining a Value Proposition. This post is an outline of the narrative of the first talk about MVPs. 

Building anything is an investment - of time and capital. Investments are probabilistic - which means there is risk involved and a chance that things will fail. Startups in particular have a high failure rate - and over 40% fail because they built something no one cared about - there was no market need. Humans hate risk - it's scary, but most importantly - failure sucks. 

This is where MVPs come in. Minimum viable products are a framework for derisking investments. MVP’s came from the Lean Startup Movement created by Eric Ries as a framework for launching new startups. 

> "The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." — Eric Ries

An MVP is a way to test the water - a small investment that helps us justify the big investment. It's a test, not necessarily the whole thing. 

Most importantly an MVP has to  be *viable* and actually solve the original problem in some way. And that product can be anything - a landing page with a promise, a service provided, or something else. 

MVP’s are about derisking, not eliminating all risk. Minimum viable products exist to help you test a hypothesis but you won’t know all the details until you actually launch. MVP’s can be applied to existing products too, not just new products. There are some examples of [successful MVP’s](https://speckyboy.com/successful-minimum-viable-products/). 

Software is getting easier to create. Risk to start is getting lower and it's easier than ever to create a fully functional MVP especially with new tools and the rise of the No Code Movement. 

Some of the most successful companies in technology started as MVPs - I'm looking forward to seeing what these students create!
