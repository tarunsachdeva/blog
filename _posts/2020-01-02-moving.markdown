Another short post today as we go through this transition.

Moving isn't unfamiliar. I've travelled my [entire life]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-31-growing-up-everywhere %}) - but ofcourse at that stage I didn't have any agency to decide where to. 

What's most surprising is that moving is a muscle that never goes away. Despite having been in one place for more than 20 years, the idea of disrupting everything doesn't feel _difficult_. It's reminded me of this innate ability to call anywhere home. Perhaps this is just the adrenaline of the entire experience but I haven't felt overwhelmed (not quite yet, atleast). It feels like a muscle that, althought atrophied a bit, hasn't quite disappeared.
