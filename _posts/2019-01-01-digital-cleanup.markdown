I decided to start the year with a quick digital cleanup project - it's an exercise to get rid of all the digital junk on my devices and online. I'll also be auditing any personal data across the internet. It will probably take a week or so the first time around, but I'm hoping it gets faster over time. Here's what I'm focusing on:

Personal Data
- Cleaning up Connected apps on Facebook / Google
- Checking if I've been [pwnd](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites) in any hacks this year, and making any password / account changes where needed
- Auditing any saved passwords in my web browser

Social
- Cleaning up my Following list on Twitter (happens more regularly)
- Archiving and Deleting Conversations in IM Apps
- Deleting unused social accounts where services provide that option

Subscriptions and Notifications
- Unsubscribing to email subscriptions and mailing lists
- Auditing any paid subscription services
- Removing myself from Slack channels and workspaces

Cleaning Clutter
- Removing old Simplenote notes and tags
- Deleting apps that I no longer use
- Deleting the "Downloads" folder on my Mac, which has become a dumping ground
- Cleaning up Desktop Icons
