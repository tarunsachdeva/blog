Software is unique in that the space of designing and developing happen so _close_ to each other. This proximity has led to a rise in designers that develop, and vice versa. The closing gap between the two fields is nothing new. What is cool is the tools of design & development starting to borrow from each other as a result. 

Design apps borrow from the world of development with features like [version control](https://www.abstract.com/) - and some add the ability to [code itself](https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer-x/code-editor/). Development environments like Xcode have long been very [design centric](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/DesigningwithStoryboards.html). As designers and developers become comfortable using tools that look familiar, this cross functional fluency will increase. The no-code movement will likely also bridge some gaps. 

This trend may even result in an altogether new discipline. With this new type of creator comes the need for a new type of creator community. It might look something halfway between Dribbble and Github, creating a space for polymathic designer/developers to learn from each other.
