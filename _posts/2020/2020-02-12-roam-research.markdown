I've been following the development of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), a "note-taking tool for networked thought". There are a few defining features:

* As you're typing a note, you can surround any word with square brackets and that will create a new note with that word as the topic. 
* As you're typing and any previously linked word is mentioned, Roam prompts you to link references to that word. This way, all notes can stay constantly linked to each other - creating a feeling of "networked thought". 
* Every day, a new dated note is created - a place for streams of consciousness to be linked to individual topic notes. 

This idea is that Roam becomes a 'second brain', a term coined by [Tiago Forte](https://www.keepproductive.com/blog/how-to-build-a-second-brain). There's an interesection of ideas between this and asynchronous work that can be applied to teamwork too. I'll be paying attention to this space closely.
