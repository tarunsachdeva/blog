This may be the spark of a new era in sharing biological information. The fear of a virus will make us all more open to tracking our biological patterns to detect early symptoms. 

If this is true, this will lead to a surge in biological data. This is highly sensitive and private in nature, and will require a wholly new type of platform or infrastructure that is decentralized, private, and can handle massive amounts of real time data.

_When_ this happens (not a matter of _if_ anymore) - software will not just eat the world - it will eat _us_.
