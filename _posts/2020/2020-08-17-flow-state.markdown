This is the first post in months. I'm working on a bigger essay right now, but I've missed publishing on this space. This is a short post is about how to trigger Flow state, and is a summary of [this article](https://medium.com/personal-growth-lab/how-to-reach-flow-state-using-10-flow-state-triggers-473aa28dc3e5) by Jari Roomer. This is especially relevant now, when people are working and learning in enviroments not initially created for productivity.

[Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) is a state of complete immersion in whatever activity someone is doing; often signalled by losing complete track of time. You know when it happens, but it _can_ be triggered. This article provides ten ways that contribute to flow state. 

1. Eliminate all _external_ distractions: put your phone away, turn off notifications.
2. Eliminate internal distractions. This is tougher but meditation and journalling help to clear the mind. Most imporantly, don't try to enter flow state when stressed. 
3. Work at your Biological Peak Time (BPT). Don't fight it if you naturally get fatigued at a certain time of day.
4. Listen to the right kind of music. Repetitive, non-vocal music, that stretches for an extended period of time. 
5. Work on one very specific task. Entering flow state with a list of things to do won't work. Pick a task. 
6. The task must be challenging enough, but not TOO challenging. If it's too difficult, it will create stress and will be difficult to reach flow (see #2)
7. Have a clear outcome or goal. When you don't know what you're working towards, you don't know when to finish, and procrastination loves it when this lack of clarity exists - it will push you towards quitting earlier.
8. Strategically consume caffeine. 200mg per day max (each cup is about 96mg). 400mg creates anxiety. 
9. Stay hydrated. Not surprising but lack of hydration leads to a distracted state of mind. 
10. Create a mental cue. A special sentence, action that you repeat _every_ time you want to enter flow state.
