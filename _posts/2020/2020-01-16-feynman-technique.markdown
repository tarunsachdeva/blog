I recently found out about the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), a learning method created by the Nobel-prize winning Physicist Richard Feynman. 

It's a simple technique to learn anything by practicing how to explain it to a child. This perspective helps us avoid complicated jargon. Explaining something in simple terms forces us to actually understand the topic at hand.

The technique itself has four steps that can be repeated:

1. Write down your explanation of the topic for a child, without using fancy jargon
2. Step 2: Review where you got stuck, and re-learn it in simpler terms.
3. Step 3: Organize into a simple narrative you can repeat.
4. Step 4 (Optional): Try it with an actual child. 

When writing this post, I used the Feynman technique to make sure I truly understood the technique itself!
