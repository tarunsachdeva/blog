Yet again, 2020 is compressing years of progress into days. Like many others, I've been watching in rage the brutality of the police over the past few weeks. 

The American criminal justice system is the last disgusting vestige of slavery. It was designed for this purpose, and it's on full display. Reform isn't strong enough - the entire system needs a grounds up rebuild.

And while Canada likes to see itself as better, it's not by much. Our brand of racism is just more hidden. We have a lot of work to do. Black Lives Matter.
