I just joined the Endcoronavirus.org Slack channel. It's mindblowing to see how people from all around the world and across multiple disciplines are working together to solve all parts of this problem. 

I don't know what the solution to this Virus is going to be but a decentralized approach is proving to be faster and more likely to succeed in finding a cure. Yes there will be some false positives, but the speed of finding a solution in a decentralized environment will far outweigh the downside. 

As much as this virus is turning into one of the worst events in modern history, it is also bringing out the best in us as a society, which is amazing to see.
