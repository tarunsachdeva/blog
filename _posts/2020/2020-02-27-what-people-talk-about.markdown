A great source of product ideas comes from daily conversations. 

Too often, products are built around _perceived_ problems. Conversations contain unfiltered signal that helps us understand people's _real_ problems. 

Too often, products are built with a "if we build it, they will come" mentality (despite best intentions of the opposite). Understanding how people recommend products helps build distribution mechanics into a product itself. 

User research should always strive towards getting signal that is as close to those daily conversations as possible.
