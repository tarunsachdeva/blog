Some info on LED wall technology:

* I recently heard about LED wall technology through [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1234160439660953601), about The upcoming Bourne Stuntacular at Universal uses a giant LED wall as background, and it's synchronized perfectly with stunt actors and props in the foreground. The result is a cinema quality production that's playing out in front of viewers eyes.
* This is also the same way that Star Wars Mandalorian was shot. ILM recently [showcased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUnxzVOs3rk) how dramatically this changed the production process. Unreal Engine also showcased LED walls in use in [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bErPsq5kPzE).
* The impact of LED wall technology has the potential to make complex production techniques more accessible. This will dramatically impact the financial structure of big budget filmmaking.
