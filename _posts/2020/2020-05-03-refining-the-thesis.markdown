The world is at home and facing the reality that the school year is going to end without students returning to classrooms. Despite this, learning hasn't stopped. Quite the opposite. And this new reality is revealing all the cracks in our existing education systems. 

There is a new system being built and will look like the confluence of some distinct trends:

- For higher education, we'll see a rise in industry providing students with job certainty in different forms. Work and school will become interleaved. Everything from financing (ISA's) to companies offering education credits as part of work.
- For those already in the workforce, there will be a massive need on upskilling and reskilling to participate in the knowledge economy. For others, it's a time to take back control, and start building their own communities and businesses online.
- In a knowledge economy, long term capital success is directly tied to the ability for companies to build intellectual moats. The best companies are learning organizations and feel like learning communities. The tools that help us in this process will go beyond communication - they will help us organize our thoughts, compound our collective knowledge and help us in the journey of learning.
