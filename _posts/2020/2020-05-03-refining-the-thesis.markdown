The thesis for this upcoming essay on the changing face of the systems of individual development is taking shape.

The world is at home and we are starting to notice that the most essential part of the education system is childcare, not learning. The latter is happening online, just as well if not better. The system isn't complete. 

There is a new system and it is centered around a few key concepts:
- The era of independence as stability
- The creation of the employee student, or interleaving "work" and "school"
- The rise of tools for thought and learning progress

With the US racing towards 30% unemployment, even jobs in the largest companies aren't synonymous with stability. Now, more than ever, we are on our own and building a business around yourself is becoming the more stable path. 

For those newly entering the workforce, the idea of taking on 4 years of school debt (and now, for online courses?) doesn't make sense. Study and work will become more interleaved in many different ways.

Work isn't just a place to practice capitalism and serve shareholders. In a knowledge economy it is a space to grow and learn. The best companies are learning organizations and feel like learning communities. 

The rise of knowledge work means that the tools that we use for organizing our thoughts, creating better habits and sharing our learning are going to play an increasingly important role.
