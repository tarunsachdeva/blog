The last published post to this blog was in August 2020. Before then, I was writing daily for almost two years. The habit was broken, but it will be built back one day at a time, starting with this post.

The world is a different place. COVID is relentless and the vaccines are a miracle. Feels like everyone's lost someone to this virus. And yet, optimism is abundant. Especially if you're building software.

The relationships we're building at 'work' and 'school' are happening in software first, and in real life second (or not at all). There's so much to explore with this change. It's a good time to help humans to do more on the internet. 

And because of this change, our days arenâ€™t regimented by a daily commute to an office. Our lives feel more fluid, and there's more space to craft the day around our _identity_.

There's so much to be explored.
