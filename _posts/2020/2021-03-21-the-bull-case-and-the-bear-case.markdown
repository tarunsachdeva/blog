The **Bull Case** is that we will quickly find a vaccine to this virus. It will help to prevent the spread, and also cure most existing patients. The curve will not be flattened - it will be smashed entirely. In the Bull Case, Government bailouts and relief packages will be enough to manage the disruption in our daily lives. The economy will return back to a new normal - a better normal - one in which we will see new opportunities and working paradigms that increase our global economic output. As Ben Hunt puts it, this will be [our finest hour](https://www.epsilontheory.com/tick-tock/). Coming together as a global community on this will have second order effects for other similar problems, like the climate crisis.

The **Bear Case** is that the virus will kill _millions_ globally, as medical infrastructures crumble under pressure. The fear of another virus will be treated like the new fear of a nuclear fallout.
