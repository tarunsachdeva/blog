Yesterday I had a conversation with a friend about new tools enabling passive learning - products like [Arist](http://www.arist.co), [UseFluent](http://www.usefluent.co), and [Toucan](http://www.arist.co). 

I've always considered Twitter to be most powerful passive learning platform in the world. 

It creates a new modality of learning not possible before - the consistent exposure to discussions amongst experts and those learning from experts. Anytime I'm interested in a topic, following Twitter users from that subcommunity or topic is a great way to immerse myself.

It also creates a natural graduation from passive to active learning through the forms of interaction - reading tweets, participating in conversations, creating new tweets about the topic. The exercise of doing everything in public creates a natural skin in the game for learning. 

Although it's primarily a social platform (can be performative, not always a safe space) - it's ability to create a natural learning experiences is pretty interesting.
