Recently, employees from tech companies from all around the world have been [posting their salaries](https://twitter.com/hashtag/KnowYourWorth) on Twitter as part of the #KnowYourWorth campaign. Many of them are early in their careers and skew towards engineering roles. 

Besides the information itself, the act of sharing signals changing attitudes towards what has been extremely sensitive in the past. This is a very good sign - information opacity has especially held back minority groups including women and people of color.

I also expect more of this to continue, and products to be built that encourage this behaviour. While Venmo and Paypal have made it easier for people to send and receive money, social finance is still in its early stages. Our attitudes and desires towards money are more nuanced and our products need to reflect that.
