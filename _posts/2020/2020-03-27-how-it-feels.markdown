Our mandatory quarantine ends tomorrow. Thankfully, no one in the family has shown any symptoms of COVID 19. We're healthy, and trying to stay positive.

We're no longer worried (as much) about being carriers of COVID, and now shifted into being more concerned about getting COVID. 

How this feels today: we've never felt so disconnected and yet connected to everyone at the same time. I look outside and everything is the same, and yet nothing ever will be. I'm still trying to reconcile billions of people collectively changing behaviour in a matter of days. Not sure we will ever see anything like this again.
