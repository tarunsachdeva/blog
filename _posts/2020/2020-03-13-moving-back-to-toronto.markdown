I've decided for the health of the family it's not safe to be in New York at the moment. I'm not confident in the healthcare system's ability to handle in the incoming wave of COVID-19 patients.

We just moved to a new place in Brooklyn _last weekend_.

We are packing again and moving back to Toronto temporarily and will self quarantine. Incase we need to be hospitalized I feel more comfortable in the Canadian system. I was discussing this with a good friend, and he added that it's probably not the right way to introduce yourself to the complexity of US healthcare. 

I'm fortunate to be able to do this at all, however inconvenient it is.
