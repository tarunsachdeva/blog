As crazy as this entire week has been, today feels like the turning point. The day we'll never forget. 

In the last hour:
* Donald Trump gave a disastrous speech meant to reassure the country (and to a certain degree, the world). It had the exact opposite effect. As of this writing, markets are tanking again.
* Tom Hanks revealed he has Coronavirus. I'm not sure why this is having such a huge impact but I suppose he's a global celebrity and it's becoming clear that this is unstoppable no matter who you are.
* The NBA is suspending its season because Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19.

A very strange combination of events but collectively it feels like the panic around COVID-19 has started in North America. I'm not sure what I'm going to be doing just yet.
