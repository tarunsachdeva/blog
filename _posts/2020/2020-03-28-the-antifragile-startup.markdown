The last 10 years saw the rise of lean startups - emphasizing learning about customers over anything else. It begins by starting with a customer problem, really understanding why people are using your product, and then building the minimum viable product to solve that problem. 

In the next few years, I predict we will see the rise of The Antifragile Startup. Antifragility is not simply resilience. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better with chaos and volatility.

Perhaps these are the same thing. Failing fast is one of the tenets of antifragility. But leanness implies an overdose of efficiency - and antifragility is the opposite of that.

Antifragile companies pass the simple test of antifragility: "anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile." While I'm not sure what kinds of companies fall under this category yet, I suspect many more are thinking about how their startups can natively turn chaos into opportunity.
