Overnight, companies and entire industries have been forced to digitize themselves. All the digital transformation efforts have gone from multi-year projects to getting done at lightning speed.

For some this means digital is driving their entire business - they are now product companies whether they like it or not. Revenue from digital products, or online commerce, has now become their sole source of income, and they are doubling down and building more of what's working. 

Others have purely operational challenges - overnight they have to enable employees to work from home just to keep business going. Enabling remote work went from being a nice-to-have to a critical function. These setups are here to stay.

I'm not sure I've ever witnessed a change so large, so quickly.
