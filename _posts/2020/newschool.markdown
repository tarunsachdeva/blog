0. So much is being torn down. Nothing is certain. 
1. Work and school are interleaved.
2. Building the enterprise of yourself. Only at the beginning of realizing what a human can do with a computer and internet connection.  
4. Using social status as a service. Status as accreditation. 
2. Work as a learning community. Learning Organiaztions. 
3. Tools for thought are going to play an important role in this world.

PERSONAL LESSONS
I started school at Bishop Mackenzie International School in Lilongwe, Malawi.

Over the next 12 years, as my father travelled for his job in the diplomatic corps, I studied at schools in Saudi Arabia, India, the Philippines and Canada.

- Live interactive learning
- Phase 1/2/3 - Asynchronous / Synchronous Live / Real Time
- Thesis - K12 and higher ed / Upskilling and reskilling
- Don't think the existing system is going to move as quickly that needs
- K12 system were built assuming scale - but the goal keeps changing 
- Systems built to not change
- Entrepreneurs will redefine K12 and higherEd - Most will fail 
- Homeschool - Colearning market
- LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR APPROACH to increase test score outcomes
- People taking matters into their own hands
- Unbundling and rebundling - 
- Unbundling in education - bundles serve adults well but not the kids well. UNbundling in education gives us opportunity to go to students and see what they did well. 
- Internet is good at: expert content, merit signals, valuable interactions. 
- Merit signals are the last thing keeping the thing from crumbling. Having the bachelors degree means a lot to employers. Most difficult thing to overcome. 
- Easier to productize delivering merit signals. Duolingo can represent my fluency in french better than taking french class in school.
- So many kids grow up thinking you have to go to college. Have to get a bachelors degree. Kids with a bachelors degree vs. not. 
- Youtube is the best instructor. 
- Federal government backs the current student loan systems - is there a world where governments get out of that loan??? Lambda starting to educate majority of students in US
- ISA ethics and cultural perspectives - sharia law etc
- Anything from private sector is looked at cynically - lot of bad actors
- Entrenched interests that don't want these walls to be torn down. 
- 10% of families would homeschool. 
- If you're competing against free it
- MAKE IT LOOK LIKE FREE!!! Charging upfront to being free.....
- Network matching - needed an accreditation partner. Maybe that can help.

FROM: https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/articulating-3-core-edtech-beliefs

We need to resist the higher ed / edtech productivity agenda.  An agenda that claims that if only higher education achieved the technologically based market efficiencies (and philosophical worldview) other industries, that we will finally achieve 'a revolution in higher education'.  (Claims that we need to create the Uber, Airbnb, and Amazon of higher education emerge with a depressing regularity).

A few key concepts:

The current system is woefully incomplete in many different ways. Distance learning is proving that school is more childcare than education. College degrees being delivered online are not worth the rising costs (education has been the biggest cost). This would be fine if this investment led to clear returns, but college students are finding themselves [DATA NEEDED] woefully unprepared for the workforce. It took COVID to realize that this system was very incomplete. 

Now more than ever, you're on your own. 20% unemployement and lack of economic stability. This means a few things - first is upskilling and reskilling. There's a trememndous opportunity to help people enter the knowledge economy. Many folks who have never worked in an office before.

Second, everyone is independent. There are so many tools available to people to make money online. The era of independence as stability: This is the notion of building a community around your own capabilities. THe Naval Ravikant, David Perell School of thought. The tools for this are shopify, slack, teachable, etc. Going through these schools is a credential in and of itsef. If you can build a community you can create a credential around yourself. YC, Ondeck, etc. 

Leaving the K-12 system means taking 4 years to study before you start working is a huge risk. You may leave not understanding job prospects. Students today are looking for more guarantees that what they study will help in their career and we're going to start work and. 

Interleaving work and school. The common structure of young adulthood is defined by a K-12 education, post secondary school, after which you are thrust into in the workplace. We are seeing new models of how industry is playing a stronger role in education. At waterloo, I was part of the coop program, which allowed me to study and work for 4 month terms. I left school with 2 years of work experience and some money. [NEED DATA] Many students leave university with minimal job prospects and a crushing student debt. 

The notion of work as a learning community. In a knowledge economy, long term capital success is directly tied to the ability for companies to build intellectual moats. The best companies are learning organizations and feel like learning communities. The companies that operate in a learning loop make better decisions over time, and increase their competitive advantage. The tools that help us in this process will go beyond communication - they will help us organize our thoughts, compound our collective knowledge and help us in the journey of learning. 

So we're starting to see this new model. The unbundling of schools as individual course communities, the interleaving of the school and work experience making the transition to industry smoother, and the recognition that work is a continual learning journey. All of this Based on a foundation of self directed learning. Our education system is too rigidly defined and needs to respond to this new infrastructure. 

The internet is the ultimate tool for self directed learning but there are a lot of opportunities still to be captured.
