0. So much is being torn down. Nothing is certain. 
1. Work and school are interleaved.
2. Building the enterprise of yourself. Only at the beginning of realizing what a human can do with a computer and internet connection.  
4. Using social status as a service. Status as accreditation. 
2. Work as a learning community. Learning Organiaztions. 
3. Tools for thought are going to play an important role in this world.

I started school at Bishop Mackenzie International School in Lilongwe, Malawi.

Over the next 12 years, as my father travelled for his job in the diplomatic corps, I studied at schools in Saudi Arabia, India, the Philippines and Canada.

A few key concepts:

The current system is woefully incomplete in many different ways. Distance learning is proving that school is more childcare than education. College degrees being delivered online are not worth the rising costs (education has been the biggest cost). This would be fine if this investment led to clear returns, but college students are finding themselves [DATA NEEDED] woefully unprepared for the workforce. It took COVID to realize that this system was very incomplete. 

The era of independence as stability: This is the notion of building a community around your own capabilities. THe Naval Ravikant, David Perell School of thought. The tools for this are shopify, slack, teachable, etc. Going through these schools is a credential in and of itsef. If you can build a community you can create a credential around yourself. YC, Ondeck, etc. 

Interleaving work and school. The common structure of young adulthood is defined by a K-12 education, post secondary school, after which you are thrust into in the workplace. We are seeing new models of how industry is playing a stronger role in education. At waterloo, I was part of the coop program, which allowed me to study and work for 4 month terms. I left school with 2 years of work experience and some money. [NEED DATA] Many students leave university with minimal job prospects and a crushing student debt. 

The notion of work as a learning community. In a knowledge economy, long term capital success is directly tied to the ability for companies to build intellectual moats. The best companies are learning organizations and feel like learning communities. The companies that operate in a learning loop make better decisions over time, and increase their competitive advantage. The tools that help us in this process will go beyond communication - they will help us organize our thoughts, compound our collective knowledge and help us in the journey of learning. 

So we're starting to see this new model. The unbundling of schools as individual course communities, the interleaving of the school and work experience making the transition to industry smoother, and the recognition that work is a continual learning journey. All of this Based on a foundation of self directed learning. Our education system is too rigidly defined and needs to respond to this new infrastructure. 

The internet is the ultimate tool for self directed learning but there are a lot of opportunities still to be captured.
