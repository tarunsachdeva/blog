I've been thinking a lot about the rise in remote work because of the COVID-19 situation globally. While a lot of people are talking about the rise of video conferencing, I think our next biggest problem is going to be how we help teams of people to collectively compound knowledge now that everyone is default not in physical proximity.

This problem exists today, but physical proximity makes it easier to resolve. You can see a person and say, yeah, hey they know about this, go talk to them. Remote makes that a bit more difficult. Social norms online don’t allow for consistent interruption. There’s a need for a tool that helps teams share their knowledge together.  

Yesterday a reader of this blog named Oliver Sung from [Junto Investments](https://junto.investments/) wrote an article about this exact topic called [The Knowledge Moat](https://junto.investments/worldly-lessons/the-knowledge-moat/). It's excellent.
