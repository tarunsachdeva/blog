My mind is a number of places these days. There are three main streams of thought:

First, I'm thinking about how we can help in this crisis. Right now, that is for the medical professionals, and also those affected by the direct economic impact. 

I'm thinking about how I to prepare myself and my family for what's coming ahead. This involves walking through all the second and third order impacts of the crisis - medical and economic - and making sure I have a response for the outcomes I can predict.

And yes, I'm also thinking about the opportunity this creates.

Through all this, I'm finding comfort in a routine. I'm finding more time to write, and more time to clarify thought. One of the few positive things these days.
