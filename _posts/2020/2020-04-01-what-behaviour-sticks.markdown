Nick Grossman [wrote](https://www.nickgrossman.is/2020/post-covid-which-behaviors-will-stick/) about what behaviours will stick in a post COVID world. I agree with many of his predictions.

> Many people are experiencing, for the first time, how many activities — work, learning, healthcare, and socializing — can be done remotely and in new ways using digital tools. For sure, when the dust settles, we will largely go back to doing things how we’ve always done them, but I suspect that certain new behaviors will stick, and will result in longer-term behavioral and economic changes.
