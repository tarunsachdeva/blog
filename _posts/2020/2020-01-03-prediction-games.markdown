An ultra short post today. It's prediction season again and this one is extra special with all the decade stuff. Some of my favorites are Fred Wilson's [What Will Happen in the 2020's](https://avc.com/2020/01/what-will-happen-in-the-2020s/), Albert Wenger's [Agenda for the 2020's](https://continuations.com/post/189997132065/an-agenda-for-the-2020s-inventing-the-knowledge) and A16Z's [Life in 2030](https://a16z.com/2019/12/30/life-in-2030/). 

My prediction: By 2030 we would be fighting our way back to the status quo (or even the past) on some things (like the climate crisis and the after effects of global nationalism). We will also see software become such an integral part of our lives that it will almost start to disappear from view altogether, [just like plastic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-05-software-and-plastic %}). That's about the level of fidelity I'm comfortable with at this point.
