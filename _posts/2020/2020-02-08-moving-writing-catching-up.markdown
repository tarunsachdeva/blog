A short reflection on the current state of writing:

In the new year, I've tried to keep up with writing everyday - one of the habits that typically anchors my day. But, of the 38 days in the new year, I've written 19 posts. It doesn't seem that bad on average, but there have been long gaps and most posts haven't been original content - mostly short summaries of other interesting articles.

Life got in the way - two kids, a new job and of course the move to New York. The daily intention exists but the morning habit is broken. Nights are when I'm the least intellectually curious and just want to wind down. 

So, the habit has to be rebuilt and I have some catching up to do.
