NFX Capital created a useful [guide](https://www.nfx.com/post/28-moves-survive-thrive-downturn/) for how companies should be thinking in a downturn. It comes down to three main categories, with a list of 28 very specific actions every company should be considering.

> 1. The first is managing losses. This will be the most difficult and painful thing you do as a CEO because it involves people, but itâ€™s often not so much about the what as it is the how. Your empathy and speed are key here.
> 2. The second is gaining ground. These are the ways you will reorient your focus, your tactics, and your team so you come out ahead after a crisis.
> 3. The third is managing psychology. It is crucial you keep yourself, your team, and those around you healthy, sane and productive.
