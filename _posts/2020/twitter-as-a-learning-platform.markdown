Twitter is the most underleveraged social platform.

It creates a new modality of learning not possible before - the exposure to conversations amongst great minds. Clubhouse is an extension of this.

Twitter is the the world's biggest newsroom, classroom, theater, talent market, + more. Wars have almost started based on tweets. 

The highest leverage social platform on the planet shouldn't run on ads.

And yet...I just saw an insurance ad, something from tourism winnipeg, and some shit about winning $1M virtual grand theft auto dollars.
