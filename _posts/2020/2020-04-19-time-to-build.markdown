Like many others, I read and then re-read Marc Andressen's rallying cry for technology, [IT'S TIME TO BUILD](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/). 

What stood out for me, naturally, was the emphasis on education, in reference to where there a smug complacency - a "satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build":

> You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn’t that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we’ve been doing education research that’s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why haven’t we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?
