In an [interview with Kara Swisher](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/chamath-palihapitiya-investing-landscape-is-done-taxes/id1011668648?i=1000469424578), Chamath outlined 3 areas of focus for what type of businesses  will be the most valuable in a post COVID world - the technologies that will enable a shift to a more resilient population.

- Hardtech infrastructure around transportation and climate. A massive investment by the government in developing infrastructure will lead to projects like high speed air and high speed rail - and all the technology + software that supports it will become extremely valuable. 
- Healthcare. Driven by the creation of the biological equivalent of the Patriot Act, healthcare will see a technological renaissance - starting with the obvious like telemedicine. I predict the creation of a biological equivalent of a credit score which will be used for everything from home caregivers to insurance providers. 
- Education. This is another area that will become remote first by default, and the public will soon realize the diminishing value of the age old college system.
