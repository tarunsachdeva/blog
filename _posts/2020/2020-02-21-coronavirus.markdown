Like many others, I've been thinking about the rapid rise in Coronavirus cases all around the world. 

This entire outbreak goes to show the fragility of our social systems. Hospitals are overcrowding with new chases. International air travel is the engine of how global business is done, but it's become the diseases' primary distribution mechanism.

In this case, paranoia might be the most appropriate response even if the disease eventually gets under control. I've already started changing and cancelling personal travel plans in response.
