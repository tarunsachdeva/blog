Compensation is a sensitive topic. We think about it often but don't discuss it openly. This informaton asymmetry creates silos where a few people are in "the know", and many others are seemingly left out. Often because they're not asking the right questions, don't know who to ask, or simply - are not sure how to start the conversation. 

I had one of these conversations recently, and I offered a friend a simple structure to think about it. But before that, there are a few other things to understand:

* Understand comparables and what is "fair". Do the research to understand what is fair and normal practice in the industry and whatever level you are at. Make sure you are equipped with this prior.
* Set expectations earlier than later. It comes more difficult to have compensation discussions when expecations are a surprise. 

The framework itself is simple - make sure you're negotating along three lines - base, upside and downside. You want a base with a good savings rate buffer,  to maximize your upside, and to minimize any downside risks. 

* Make sure your base covers living comfortably, with a good buffer for savings. My target was 60-70% of my base should cover my living expenses - including mortgages / nannies etc. The rest would go into savings. I think in a world where pensions are not the norm, a 30-40% savings rate should be considered "normal". Life circumstances become a good negotiation lever - it's hard to push back on. New houses, kids, parents to support, all that helps. 

* Maximize your upside (equity, bonuses etc) - make sure you’re able to participate in the long term success of the company. In startupworld, equity is the name of the game but I think we'll soon see different forms of [long term equity compensation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long_term_incentive-plan.asp). Long term bonus and equity are more difficult than any other category to negotiate when you're in the job, so doing this upfront is important. You can negotiate the “option to reevaluate” any part of this if the company doesn't have formal performance planning and associated compensation adjustments. 

* Minimuze your downside - Make sure you have severance included. This is your only time to negotiate your severance package. It can be an uncomfortable discussion but they expect it to happen but never bring it up. You have to do this yourself, and it’s a good signal. It’s standard to ask for at least 9-12 months.

I'll be adding to this as more thoughts arise on this topic.
