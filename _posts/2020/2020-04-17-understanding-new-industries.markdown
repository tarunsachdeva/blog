Some thoughts on the highest leverage activities I'm doing to get better immersed in the world of online education. Many of these methods can be used to better understand any industry.

To understand the current state of the industry:
* Reading the most recommended books on the state of Education. I've started compiling an [Amazon wishlist](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3V2B7L3PGGOQ0). 
* Talking to industry leaders to understand their understanding of the first principles of the industry, and understand the story of their organizaitons growth. 
* Spend time in meta-learning - learning how to best learn the space - by understanding the key nodes in the education system and how they interact with each other. 
* Talking to all participants in the value chain, but starting with end users because their demand fuels everything downstream.
* Visualize and write about the way the system works - how one group of organizations creates customers for another, or the flow of dollars from one company to another. 
* Going through the app stores for the category - it helps understand what exists to day to solve some of the core problems in the industry. 
* Follow leaders in the space on Twitter to get a better sense of current problems, concerns and how the industry is connected to each other. 

To understand where the future is going:
* Understanding where venture deals are happening in the industry (and talking to foremost VC's that invest in the space), which helps to understand where innovation is happening. 
* Talk to founders of new and existing startups in that space, at all stages from pre-seed to late-stage.
