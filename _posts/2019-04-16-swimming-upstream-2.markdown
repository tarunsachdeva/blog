Yesterday's post on [swimming upstream]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-15-swimming-upstream %}) was an incomplete thought.

Swimming upstream also means working on something, and then realizing that it's not going to work - but then staying persistent. 

It happens with so many pursuits - whether it's a client, a job, or a relationship. They string you along but never say no, and you continue your pursuit in the face of all odds. 

There's an argument that being persistent in the small pursuits can be helpful. There's no doubt about that. Even the process creates learning. 

I guess swimming upstream is just another way of saying **pick your battles**, and for the ones you can't win - stop fighting.
