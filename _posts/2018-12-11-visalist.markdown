VisaList is a new app that was featured on ProductHunt yesterday. It's a simple app - a user enters their country of citizenship, and then are shown all the countries where they can travel with a visa, a special permit, or without any visa. 

It's a deceptively simple app, but can easily be extended to become the first place where travel plans start. Most often, travel plans take visa requirements for granted.

It can also be extended beyond travel visas to work and education visas, and serve a starting point for larger migration decisions that hinge on visa requirements.

Having travelled all my life, I'm way too familiar with visa rules across the world - whether they are related to travel, study, work or immigration. Something like VisaList can become starting point to a very underserved market.
