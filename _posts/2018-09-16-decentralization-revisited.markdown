**NOTE**: A few days, ago, I [wrote]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-14-web3-decentralization %}) about decentralization as the foundational concept behind [Web 3]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-06-future-fridays-web3 %}). In this post, I wanted to dig into this a bit further - specifically focusing on the power shift between applications to protocols, and why this is so important. Again, there are a [number](http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols) of [amazing](https://continuations.com/post/105272022635/bitcoin-clarifying-the-foundational-innovation-of) [articles](https://continuations.com/post/148098927445/crypto-tokens-and-the-coming-age-of-protocol) that helped me develop my understanding of this topic.

The Internet we know today exists because of two fundamental aspects of software: **protocols** and **applications**.

**Protocols** are the defined _rules_ of how information is transmitted between computers on the internet. Some of the most important protocols for the today's internet are [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite), [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP), [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP), and [others](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Network_Plus_Certification/Technologies/Common_Protocols). 

**Applications** are what end users interact with. Applications provide additional higher order functions (like presentation, logic, and memory) that _uses_ these protocols for communication. These higher order functions necessary to create any useful product or service for end users: the _presentation layer_ provides interfaces to interact with, the _memory layer_ (or _data layer_) provides the ability to store data, and the _logic layer_ provides additional functional capability.

Put together, these layers provide the building blocks for today's internet applications. This structure is reflected in popular development frameworks like [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

Applications today have **all** the control over the presentation, logic and data of their products and services. This has allowed for incredible innovations, convenience to end users, and ultimately a lot of value created. Application developers today represent some of the most valuable companies in the world.

However, any abuse, neglect or irresponsibility on the part of their developers (in any layer) can have major negative downstream impact. The popularity of mobile and internet services makes this level of control a social and political issue around the world. We are seeing this play out in various ways.

From the beginning of the Internet until recently, there really was no **technical solution** to the problem of applications having full control of layers of internet products. There simply was no other way to provide the same level of service without control over presentation, logic and data.

This changed with the arrival of **Bitcoin** in 2008. Bitcoin's underlying invention was the Blockchain. The blockchain provides **a framework for _data_ and _logic_ to live outside the application layer, and into the protocol layer itself**.

Without knowing how any of it actually works, just this simple fact is important - **that data and logic no longer are only in the control of an application developer**. This can be an existential threat for some of the most valuable companies in the world which are built on the existing structure of value in the application layer.

Decentralization is the process of making this change - of products and services moving into the shared protocol layer, with fundamentally different incentives and power structures than what exists today.
