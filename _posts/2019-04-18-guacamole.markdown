Some days (like today) I don't feel like writing. Lack of sleep compounds quickly, and I'm ready to call it. I'm just going to share my guacamole recipe - something I've been perfecting over the last _decade_. 

You can make a decent guacamole just by cutting all the veggies and mashing it all together. The key here is order of operations - it's the difference between good and fucking amazing. I've won a few backyard cooking contests purely with this side. 

Summer's almost here, so enjoy.

**Ingredients**
- 3 medium sized ripening avocados
- 3 fresh Roma Tomatoes, unrefrigerated
- 1 handful of fresh cilantro leaves picked off the stem
- 1 medium sized red onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- Caribbean scotch bonnet hot sauce
- 2 limes
- 1 tsp salt

**Instructions:**
1. Chop up avocados, mash lightly in a large bowl. Squeeze limes into the mixture and add ½ Tsp salt. Let this marinade while you chop the vegetables, for about 10-15 minutes.
2. Take the core out of the Roma tomatoes. Chop up tomatoes, onions into small cubes ½ inch cubes. Chop up cilantro into small pieces. Mash 2 cloves of garlic. 
3. Fully mash the avocados, and then mix in the tomatoes, onions, garlic and cilantro with a spoon.
4. Taste and add more salt, lime juice and hot sauce based on personal preferences.
5. Eat immediately or after refrigerating for 30 minutes.
