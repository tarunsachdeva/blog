I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/nickcandito/status/1080488425365667841) today and listened to the linked A16Z podcast. The episode itself talks about a number of topics but at around 26 minutes, Ben Horowitz expands on the two predictors of great management:

1. Systems thinking - the ability to understand how one change affects another, and that almost _everything_ is a system. Most people are not systems thinkers.

2. Perspective - The ability to really see the people in your organization - to know who they are, what their motivations are - and understand implications of your actions through their eyes. 

I couldn't agree more. Taking a systems thinking approach to leadership is fundamental to the [leadership lattice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-20-leadership-lattice-simplified %}) - the learning framework for management that I've written about a number of times.
