I've been following the React Native project since its inception a few years ago. I'm particularly excited about the simplicity it created for mobile app development with the component architecture.  

Recently the RN team published a roadmap for where it's going - and it's an [interesting read](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/11/01/oss-roadmap).
