I don't really feel like writing much today, so I spent the evening catching up on music I've been meaning to listen to for a while. 

The first is a mix from [DJ Filthy Rich](https://soundcloud.com/djfilthyrich), blending the two classics Enter the 36 Chambers by the Wu Tang Clan and Midnight Marauders by A Tribe called Quest. This mix was released on November 9 - the same day the two albums were released in 1993.

The next is "A Short Story About War" - the newest offering from Shad K, a Juno Award winning rapper.
