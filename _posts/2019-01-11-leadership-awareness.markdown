A short and abstract post about awareness and action.

Companies work like complex systems. Essential to leadership is simply developing greater _awareness_ of the system in which you’re operating, and then an understanding of how to take _action_ on it.

In the context of management - _awareness_ is understanding the people, how they work together, the output of their collaboration, how that is received, and it's broader impact. Awareness is an exercise in listening and learning. 

Awareness is also about understanding your peer group and governance structure, and what they and their organizations need to be successful. Managing anything in an organization requires the ability to influence change in all those directions. Doing so will make you a better citizen of your organization. 

When any action is needed - whether the change is sudden or gradual - lasting impact requires a greater sensitivity and awareness of your ‘company system’.
