The last published post to this blog was in August 2020. Before then, I was writing daily for almost two years. The habit has to be rebuilt, starting with this short post. 

The world is a different place. COVID is relentless and the vaccines are a miracle. Feels like everyone's lost someone to this virus. And yet, optimism is abundant. Especially if you're building software.

The relationships we're building at 'work' and 'school' are happening in software first, and in real life second (or not at all). It's a good time to help humans to do more on the internet, and there's so much to explore.

And because of this change, the day is regimented by our identity, not a daily commute to an office. Life just feels more **fluid**.
