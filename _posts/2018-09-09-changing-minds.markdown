There's no doubt we're living in a time of historical significance and social change. On one hand, there is landmark progress being made in advancing the rights of marginalized communities. On the other hand, xenophobia and nationalism is on the rise.

I was curious about the phenomenon of _how large groups of people change their mind_, and how that's happened in different contexts. I came across a few interesting articles.

* This article, [I Don't Want to Be Right](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/i-dont-want-to-be-right) from the New Yorker in 2014 talks about a study about changing minds about vaccinations - and how a pure fact based approach doesn't work.

* [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/7/11380974/reduce-prejudice-science-transgender) wrote about a [scientific study](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1366) conducted that shows the impact authentic dialogue plays in changing attitudes.

* [Planck's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_principle) is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views. Essentially, you can't change minds - you just have to wait for people to die. I'm curious if there's an equivalent theory regarding social progress.

* A great article from HBR called [How Social Movements Change Minds](https://hbr.org/2015/07/how-social-movements-change-minds) talks about the attributes of successful social movements - how they start by attacking perception, grow through building connections, and connect to the mainstream. 

One great quote from the article above:
> That’s a lesson we’ve seen over and over in the social movements of the last century—although the outside observer may only notice the movement when the dominoes start falling, the people inside the movement worked tirelessly for months, years, or even decades, to change minds.
