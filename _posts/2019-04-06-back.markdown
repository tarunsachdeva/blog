I'm back from vacation. 4 nights in the Belizian rainforest. 

I had all intentions to write something everyday. **I didn't write a thing.**

Maybe it was the lazy afternoons by the pool. Or the rum cocktails. Or maybe it was just months of taking care of twins. We were tired.

But I did _think_ about it, a fair amount. It was weird to go to bed without having published something. 

I could _feel_ the habit unravelling slowly, and it made me uncomfortable. 

The muscle is twitching; pen needs to hit paper. So this is it, a reminder of that time. For when it might happen again.
