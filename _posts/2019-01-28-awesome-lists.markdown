A short post today after an evening of shovelling snow.

[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list) are Github repositories that contain links about all sorts of useful things - mostly related to programming (but not restricted to it). 

> An awesome list is a list of awesome things curated by the community. There are awesome lists about everything from CLI applications to fantasy books. The main repository serves as a curated list of awesome lists.

The other day I stumbled upon an Awesome List about [applying ML to source code](https://github.com/src-d/awesome-machine-learning-on-source-code). 

It would be hard to find this depth of information about a niche topic like that. It's like a Wikipedia for programming, and is a helpful corner of the Internet.
