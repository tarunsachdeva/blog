Good to Great, published in 2001 by Jim Collins is a leadership classic. It describes the few factors that help a company go from, well, good to great. 

The book focuses on ideas across the lattice- from managing one self as a leader to confronting brutal facts about the reality of business environments. I've used the book summary provided [here](http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Good_to_Great:_Why_Some_Companies_Make_the_Leap..._and_Others_Don%27t) to help outline some of the key concepts from the book.

* Level 5 leadership is the art of showing determinism and humility - something that shows up when managing one self and also managing individuals and teams
* The notion of "Who, then What" is an underlying approach - it's a recognition that people and teams are the highest point of leverage for management. In leadership lattice, it's a recognition that most of the work is done in the domains of individuals and teams.
* Confronting the Brutal Facts is an idea best applied in the application domain - it's important to create a culture in which the truth of the business environment is shared - good and bad - to help people make the best possible decisions.
* The Hedgehog Concept - the ability to be the best at _something_ - is applied in the application domain as well, although it doesn't really fit neatly in the lattice.
* The culture of discipline / determination is fostered in people and teams to help achieve the outcomes in the application domain.
* Technology accelerators is an interesting concept not covered in many leadership books. It talks about how companies approach new technology. This is a lesson from the application domain.

Overall, Good to Great fits within the lattice but it is primarily a book about company building with some leadership lessons peppered throughout.
