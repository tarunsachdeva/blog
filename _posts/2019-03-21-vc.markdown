A16 has a [thorough rundown](https://a16z.com/2016/09/11/vc-economics/) of the economic structures of venture capital. This paragraph on the impact of VC on the US economy really stuck out to me.

> Yet the entrepreneurial ecosystem that VCs have the privilege to help fund punches well above its weight in terms of impact on the U.S. economy: According to a study conducted at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, 43% of U.S. public companies founded since 1979 were funded by venture capital. These companies now comprise 38% of all employees, 57% of the total U.S. market capitalization, and account for 82% of all R&D spend -- a proxy for further innovation growth -- in the United States.
