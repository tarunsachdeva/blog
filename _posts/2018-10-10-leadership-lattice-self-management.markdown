This is part of a series of posts about a Leadership Lattice.

Managing yourself as a leader is a critical element of the leadership lattice. This lattice is a framework of learning - which in itself is a concern of the domain of self management.

This domain is concerned with managing what you as an individual manager or leader have full agency over - your time, attention, knowledge, capability and emotion. Your ability as a leader to manage each of these areas will have broader impacts on the individuals you manage and the team dynamics, which in turn will have second order impacts across the entire lattice.

Much of what I cover in my posts on [productivity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-04-productivity-tuesday-habits %}) are practices in the domain of self management, which is why I've called 'productivity' the art/science of **practicing leadership on yourself**.

Self management is comprised of the following practices, among others:
* Managing your emotional and mental health - This is foundational to self management, and includes practices that help you manage your emotional state. Leadership is all consuming, and it can become a tremendous emotional burden if not managed actively.
* Managing your time and attention - you have just as many hours in the day as everyone else in your org, and yet a disproportionate set of responsibilities. This includes understanding where your time is being spent today, how is should be best spent, and where you can have the most leverage. 
* Managing your knowledge and capability - your growth as a leader is a function of how quickly you learn. Actively managing your own learning capability is critical to your leadership capability. This lattice is an attempt to make this process easier

This is the last domain in the lattice. In previous weeks, we covered:
* [The Individual Domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-12-leadership-practice-individual-domain %})
* [The Organization Domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-19-leadership-latticework-organization %})
* [The Application Domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-27-leadership-lattice-application-domain %})
* [The Impact Domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-04-leadership-lattice-impact-domain %})

In a future post, I'll be writing a summary of all of these domains and how they work together as an interconnected system.
