As if by fate, I found this article by Sriram Krishnan on [The First 30 Days](https://sriramk.com/exec-101-first-thirty-days) for a new exec in any organization. He summarized a few lessons from his experience:

1. Relax. 
2. Meet everyone.
3. Make obvious people changes, quickly.
4. Build key relationships.
5. Pick a crisis or early win (and don't mess it up)
6. Communicate (regularly).
