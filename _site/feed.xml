Some very disconnected thoughts on the VisionPro:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Eye tracking + pinch interaction sounds absolutely wild. Look at an app, pinch to selectüëåüèΩ. Very reminiscent of how iPhone touchscreen was 10x better than others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feels like a new design space for accessibility. Can even imagine apps to help those with nervous system disorders (e.g. stroke victims) recover certain coordination functions, once more apps become a thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might not be intentional but enabling 2D apps in 3D is a great way to onboard existing devs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naming it Vision Pro (vs. just Vision) is in line with a strong tradition of consumer vs. pro products. Also makes sense why Productivity is the leading message Vision Pro (my guess is ‚ÄúVision‚Äù will focus on entertainment + ‚Äúconnection‚Äù features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not hard to imagine an entire media ecosystem available ‚ÄúOnly on Apple Vision‚Äù. Strong Apple TV+ play here too, possibly. Apple plays long games so this is probably many years out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The world is a different place. COVID is relentless and the vaccines are a miracle. Feels like everyone‚Äôs lost someone to this virus. And yet, optimism is abundant. Especially if you‚Äôre building software.</p>

<p>The relationships we‚Äôre building at ‚Äòwork‚Äô and ‚Äòschool‚Äô are happening in software first, and in real life second (or not at all). It‚Äôs a good time to help humans to do more on the internet, and there‚Äôs so much to explore.</p>

I‚Äôm working on a bigger essay right now, but I‚Äôve missed publishing on this space. This is a short post is about how to trigger Flow state, and is a summary of <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth-lab/how-to-reach-flow-state-using-10-flow-state-triggers-473aa28dc3e5">this article</a> by Jari Roomer. This is especially relevant now, when people are working and learning in enviroments not initially created for productivity.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> is a state of complete immersion in whatever activity someone is doing; often signalled by losing complete track of time. You know when it happens, but it <em>can</em> be triggered. This article provides ten ways that contribute to flow state.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eliminate all <em>external</em> distractions: put your phone away, turn off notifications.</li>
  <li>Eliminate internal distractions. This is tougher but meditation and journalling help to clear the mind. Most imporantly, don‚Äôt try to enter flow state when stressed.</li>
  <li>Work at your Biological Peak Time (BPT). Don‚Äôt fight it if you naturally get fatigued at a certain time of day.</li>
  <li>Listen to the right kind of music. Repetitive, non-vocal music, that stretches for an extended period of time.</li>
  <li>Work on one very specific task. Entering flow state with a list of things to do won‚Äôt work. Pick a task.</li>
  <li>The task must be challenging enough, but not TOO challenging. If it‚Äôs too difficult, it will create stress and will be difficult to reach flow (see #2)</li>
  <li>Have a clear outcome or goal. When you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre working towards, you don‚Äôt know when to finish, and procrastination loves it when this lack of clarity exists - it will push you towards quitting earlier.</li>
  <li>Strategically consume caffeine. 200mg per day max (each cup is about 96mg). 400mg creates anxiety.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated. Not surprising but lack of hydration leads to a distracted state of mind.</li>
  <li>Create a mental cue. A special sentence, action that you repeat <em>every</em> time you want to enter flow state.</li>

<p>Today, the structure of online courses is so much more, and some of the more successful ones I‚Äôve seen have common elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They all come with a supportive community of peers learning the same thing. Whether it‚Äôs a Slack group or Discourse forum, what you‚Äôre learning is just as important as <em>who you‚Äôre learning with</em>.</li>
  <li>They center around the instructor first, not the content. Twitter is an incredible learning platform because the act of Following is an indication of interest. Some people join courses today because the relationship with the course content starts with their connection with the instructor. Traditionally, you choose a course topic and then get introduced to the instructor.</li>
  <li>They encourage public accountability. The act of creating things in public (through writing and other creative fields) creates a natural skin-in-the-game.</li>
  <li>Built in status through exclusivity. Being a part of a (sometimes) restricted community creates a feeling of exclusivity. Completing the course and being a part of the alumni network carries social status too, just in the same way graduating from a university would.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, moving to a default digital space in education means we‚Äôre seeing a lot of the shared support structures around courses that a ‚Äúschool‚Äù would provide be available to every course itself. It‚Äôs an interesting shift.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first generation of online courses focused on the structured delivery of [mostly] video content, sometimes with accompanying materials.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Twitter and Passive Learning (Updated)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20200527/twitter-learning-platform.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Twitter and Passive Learning (Updated)" /><published>2020-05-27T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-27T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20200527/twitter-learning-platform</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20200527/twitter-learning-platform.html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I had a conversation with a friend about new tools enabling ‚Äòpassive learning‚Äô - non-traditional platforms that facilitate learning through your existing media diet. For example, <a href="http://www.arist.co">Arist</a>, which delivers learning content through regular text messages. Others optimize for moments of heightened curiosity in any subject, instead of a fixed curriculum based progression. Browser extensions like <a href="http://www.usefluent.co">UseFluent</a>, and <a href="http://www.jointoucan.com">Toucan</a> are examples of this. Each platform affordance creates for different modes of storytelling and recall.</p>

<p>And while these platforms are really interesting, Twitter is the biggest passive learning platform in the world.</p>

<p>It creates a new learning modality not possible before - the consistent exposure to discussions amongst experts and those learning from experts. Anytime I‚Äôm interested in a topic, following Twitter users from that subcommunity or topic is a great way to immerse myself.</p>

<p>It also creates a natural graduation from passive to active learning through the forms of interaction - reading tweets, participating in conversations, creating new tweets about the topic. The exercise of doing everything in public creates a natural skin in the game for learning.</p>

<p>Although it‚Äôs primarily a social platform (can be performative, not always a safe space) - it‚Äôs ability to create a natural learning experiences is pretty interesting.</p>

<p>UPDATE: A <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1265875306901934081">tweet from Naval</a> today reminded me of how lists can be used to shape Twitter into a learning platform vs. a social platform. You can create lists around experts in your areas of interest - and Twitter allows you (on mobile) to add them as additional tabs besides your primary feed. Really cool and underused capability.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I had a conversation with a friend about new tools enabling ‚Äòpassive learning‚Äô - non-traditional platforms that facilitate learning through your existing media diet.

I‚Äôve missed this space, as my days feel incomplete without some kind of creative output.</p>

<p>Felt apt to start again by chronicling how it all feels. Since my last post, the virus spread is continuing. Many countries have managed to flatten the curve and places like Singapore have even stopped a second outbreak. But it continues is some of the larget countries. China is going back into lockdown. Brazil‚Äôs leadership is completely ignoring the virus and will quickly take over the US in cases. The US just crossed 100,000 deaths, more than the lives lost in Vietnam. India‚Äôs cases are rising, despite strict lockdowns and contact tracing infrastructure.</p>

<p>So, this isn‚Äôt over. Not even close.</p>

<p>We are back in Canada after a few months in New York, putting that life adventure on pause. Healthy, content, and planning for the future.</p>

<p>My daily routine has evolved. I‚Äôm up earlier, working out and meditating more. But the workday is intense. I‚Äôve also noticed people are becoming very, very tired of this shit. The burden on everyone is huge and parents have a unique set of challenges. Most schools have cancelled the school year. Knowledge workers around the world are becoming accustomed to a digital by default workday. Childcare is becoming a real issue for families that are balancing it all.</p>

<p>Over and above anything else I‚Äôm thinking of the opportunities around us. Moving our spaces of learning and working into a digital space <em>by default</em> is probably the biggest societal change I might ever witness.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It‚Äôs been too long since I‚Äôve posted.

Despite this, learning hasn‚Äôt stopped. Quite the opposite. And this new reality is revealing cracks in our existing education system.</p>

<p>Some thoughts on what‚Äôs going on and predictions on what might happen, across different stages‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>K-12 systems will like return in a physical form, driven by the need for a safe haven for children while parents are working. Public K-12 is government funded, so the system will only meaningfully change if that investment can respond to the needs of students. We will likely see a rise in homeschooling and privatized education at lower costs, to make up for the inadequate public schooling system.</li>
  <li>For systems of higher education, there will be a few key changes. First, the move to digital delivery will bring down the price of getting a ‚Äòpremium‚Äô education. That‚Äôs only the first of many other n-th order effects here. Second, we‚Äôll see more innovation in schools providing certainty of a successful career (most schools have been training people for the wrong thing). Everything from financing (ISA‚Äôs) to companies offering education credits as part of work. This will see the notion of school and working becoming interleaved.</li>
  <li>We‚Äôll see a rise in platforms targeted at self directed learners - students that want to define their own curiculum and learn at their own pace. ‚ÄúK-12‚Äù and ‚Äúhigher education‚Äù are simply labels and remnants of the past system.</li>
  <li>For those already in the workforce, there will be a massive need on upskilling and reskilling to participate in the knowledge economy. For others, it‚Äôs a time to take back control, and start building their own communities and businesses online.</li>
  <li>In a knowledge economy, long term capital success is directly tied to the ability for companies to build intellectual moats. The best companies are learning organizations and feel like learning communities. The tools that help us in this process will go beyond communication - they will help us organize our thoughts, compound our collective knowledge and help us in the journey of learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly there is a new system being created, and more change is quickly approaching.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world is at home and facing the reality that the school year is going to end without students returning to classrooms.

It is a set of questions and thoughts for a broader essay on how broader technological advancement plays out in education and work.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To understand the future we should look into the past. How did the current K-12 and college come to be? What was the innovation that drove the creation of these institutions? What can we learn from those forces, if anything. Detail some of the forces of government, religion and industry have played defining roles in the formation and purpose of some of the world‚Äôs ‚Äòtop‚Äô schools.</li>
  <li>Let‚Äôs dive into the relationship between industry and education. How have they played a role in the past, and how do these forces drive each other. Look into the major revolutions - agricultural, industrial and information.</li>
  <li>In the knowledge economy, education and work are tied together much more closely than prior revolutions. In the past - education was theory and work was practical. Now, those worlds are intertwined. Learning never stops, and the application is fundamental to the learning experience. These facts reinforce the connection:
    <ul>
      <li>Companies are playing increasing roles in supporting the student journey (from the rise in co-operative education, ISA‚Äôs, to company sponsored education). Examples of this are Lambda, Holberton, Springboard.</li>
      <li>Companies are learning machines that produce capital and knowledge. They behave like learning communities. In the past, the knowledge of company operation could be managed by a small group of executives. Now, there is so much knowledge being created at all levels that acting on business knowledge is required at all levels.</li>
      <li>The tools of learning are shared with the tools of working. What we do to compound information, individually and in teams, play roles in achieving student outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As education and work become more intertwined, credentialism doesn‚Äôt just belong to the education sector. A 5 year stint at Google may be more respected and lead to better economic outcomes than a Harvard degree. But it goes beyond that. We have to recognize that learning is a lifelong journey and people acquire skills throughout their life - and our credential system looks less like a diploma mounted on a wall. It looks a set of badges representing skills both learned and applied. There is an interesting opportunity to turn every college degree into a set of badges, and solve the global credentialling crisis where credit isn‚Äôt recognized across borders.</li>
  <li>We are seeing a micro-ization of work and education. The rise of the gig economy is allowing people to diversify their income streams. Self directed workers, the micro-entrepreneurs. The availability of online resources making self directed learning impossibly easy. Instead of spending years at school and then years at work, people have started time dividing their careers into smaller chunks. 8 years seems like a lifetime at a company.</li>
  <li>This is not a zero sum game - the existing education system will always have a role to play, but the rise of a new system will allow for self directed learners and workers. This brings opportunity to support this infrastructure as well.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Software that enables the delivery of educational material over the internet (e.g. Coursera, Skillshare).</li>
  <li>Software that enables the operation of schools and universities (e.g. Tophat).</li>
</ol>

<p>Put even more critically, both camps fall into the category of software that recreates in-person educational experiences. Software is a perfect innovation space for rapid experimentation, and it has been underleveraged for education.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm interested in what happens when we approach this problem from first principles - breaking things down to their essential truths and building upwards. In this case, the essential truths are students desire to learn and achieve a specific outcome.</p>

<p>Everything else can and probably should change.</p>

<p>I think we still have a ways to go to create <em>software native</em> educational experiences - ones have no physical equivalents at all and simply cannot exist without software itself.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The education software industry today can roughly be divided into two camps:]]></summary></entry></feed>
