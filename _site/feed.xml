&lt;p&gt;A marketplace is a system, and building one from scratch requires a keen sense of equilibrium on all sides. If you have too much supply, your early suppliers will leave for lack of opportunity. If demand outstrips supply, you will be left with unhappy customers (first impressions are difficult to change, although not impossible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect is timing to make adjustments. In the early stage, you have to constantly tune and tweak your marketplace so that everyone is happy - quickly osscilating to resolve issues to help suppliers be successful and make customers happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds obvious but every initiative (project, feature, task) should have direct impact on your current marketplace. Avoid building something that will only have &lt;em&gt;second order impact&lt;/em&gt; without any meaningful changes to the &lt;em&gt;current market&lt;/em&gt;. Ask yourself - if this was built tomorrow, would our marketplace immediately change? If the answer is no, reconsider the level of investment. We buy the luxury of time when things are more established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ofcourse many ways of maintaining equilibrium early. The most sustainable is to onboard early users slowly so that maintaining equilibrium is never a huge issue. Making sure you have a good feedback channel is critical during this time too. The other approach is to ensure your ability to iterate on changes is rapid enough to address any rising issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Some thoughts on how systems thinking can be applied to marketplace development in early stages:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shape Up</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190710/shape-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shape Up" /><published>2019-07-10T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-10T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190710/shape-up</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190710/shape-up.html">&lt;p&gt;Another book from the crew at Basecamp - this one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/&quot;&gt;Shape Up&lt;/a&gt;, and details their development process with illustrations.

&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of the world of gaming and virtual currencies. In-app purchases and subscriptions are often mapped to coins, passes, candy and other currencies that can be redeemed in an app. Once they have been translated into these virtual currencies, we can similarly innovate on different business models that might work best in a specific scenario. For example, we can use the subscription API to give users coins every month (instead of simple access), and then use those coins to purchase content or pay other users in an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This full capability (especially that to pay users with coins) isn’t yet possible with the In-app purchase API’s provided by Apple and Google. But ultimately, the behaviours that have a lot of traction will then get adopted into those platform API’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of Facebook - the world’s largest social network - as a game, the Libra cryptocurrency is their virtual good. Difference being that they’re not the only ones controlling it. It has value pegged to real currency, can be used to trade goods and services, and can be traded in for other currencies on different exchanges. More so, when another app uses Libra, it creates network effect for that currency and the utility value increases for users of Libra. Already, Uber, Ebay, Lyft, Spotify and others have joined. More mature games have multiple currencies running in parallel, much in the same way there are hundreds of possible cryptocurrencies to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s modelling our personalities and relationships.
It’s modelling how we tell stories through words, music, and video and games. 
It’s modelling our money and how we interact with it.
It’s modelling how we trust and look for social proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now wear our software, live, breathe and sleep in it. We can almost touch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But software is imperfect: the map is not the territory. Models often over simplify and leave out the niches and edge cases, often excluding people without intending. It’s the job of the designers and builders to make sure that doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A model is a simulation, and through that simulation we can create exponential outcomes. When those stay in the software space, they seem harmless. But when you reach a certain scale, that simulation can have unintended real-world effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I don’t like to think of software as eating the world; rather just modelling it.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Kawhi</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190706/kawhi.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Kawhi" /><published>2019-07-06T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-06T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190706/kawhi</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190706/kawhi.html">&lt;p&gt;What a difference a day makes.

It’s appropriate that Toronto is having the most &lt;em&gt;Canadian&lt;/em&gt; possible response: we’re upset, but we’re not angry. He wanted to go home. You can’t be mad at that.&lt;/p&gt;

This would indicate instructors should cater their courses to every individual. So if someone is a visual learner we should look for a way to visually represent our lessons to them. Except this isn’t always true and most importantly doesn’t always lead to better outcomes. I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://career.ucsf.edu/sites/career.ucsf.edu/files/Article%20UCSF%20SEJC%20January%202017.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on this topic which concludes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Theories of learning styles suggest that individuals think and learn best in different ways. These are not differences of ability but rather preferences for processing certain types of information or for processing information in certain types of way. If accurate, learning styles theories could have important implications for instruction because student achievement would be a product of the interaction of instruction and the student’s style. There is reason to think that people view learning styles theories as broadly accurate, but, in fact, scientific support for these theories is lacking. We suggest that educators’ time and energy are better spent on other theories that might aid instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific American &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-with-learning-styles/&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; something similar, that while people understand they have different learning styles, they don’t behave rationally in picking the right learning strategy. From the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite knowing their own, self-reported learning preferences, nearly 70% of students failed to employ study techniques that supported those preferences. Most visual learners did not rely heavily on visual strategies (e.g., diagrams, graphics), nor did most reading/writing learners rely predominantly on reading strategies (e.g., review of notes or textbook), and so on. Given the prevailing belief that learning styles matter, and the fact many students blame poor academic performance on the lack of a match between their learning style and teachers’ instructional methods, one might expect students to rely on techniques that support their personal learning preferences when working on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
