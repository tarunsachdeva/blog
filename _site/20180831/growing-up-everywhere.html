  <h2>Growing Up Everywhere</h2>
  

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Everyone who knows me well enough has heard this story multiple times. It’s an important part of my identity, and something I think about frequently as a new parent.</p>

<p>My childhood was characterized by movement - my father worked as an officer in the Indian Diplomatic corps, and we moved to different countries in three year stretches until I was 18, when I settled in Canada.</p>

<p>I was born in New Delhi, India in July of 1981.  When I was an infant, we moved to Copenhagen, Denmark. My parents tell me I spoke Danish pretty well but I remember none of it.</p>

<p>The next post was Lilongwe, Malawi, a small country above South Africa. I started school in Malawi at a British School.</p>

<p>In 1991, we moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This was the time of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">first Gulf War</a>. It was a scary time to live in the region, in the shadow of constant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXOQ9cDwxLY">scud missile attacks</a>.</p>

<p>In 1994 we returned to New Delhi and spent 2 years at an Army School.</p>

<p>Following that was 3 years in Manila, Philippines, where I started high school at the incredible <a href="http://www.ismanila.org/">International School of Manila</a>.</p>

<p>I arrived in Toronto, Canada in 1997. I moved out and went to <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">university</a> and after 3 years, my parents continued their travels and went to Ethiopia, Ottawa and Brasillia. I visited them frequently wherever they were, but eventually settled and became a Citizen in 2013.</p>

<p>I love Toronto and Canada and the fact that it provides exposure to so many cultures. That said, I always appreciated the depth of cultural diversity in my childhood - especially so now that I’m a parent myself.</p>
