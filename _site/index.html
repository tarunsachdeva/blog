              <p>Cool to see Apple doing what they do best. Some very disconnected thoughts on the VisionPro:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Eye tracking + pinch interaction sounds absolutely wild. Look at an app, pinch to selectüëåüèΩ. Very reminiscent of how iPhone touchscreen was 10x better than others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feels like a new design space for accessibility. Can even imagine apps to help those with nervous system disorders (e.g. stroke victims) recover certain coordination functions, once more apps become a thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might not be intentional but enabling 2D apps in 3D is a great way to onboard existing devs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naming it Vision Pro (vs. just Vision) is in line with a strong tradition of consumer vs. pro products. Also makes sense why Productivity is the leading message Vision Pro (my guess is ‚ÄúVision‚Äù will focus on entertainment + ‚Äúconnection‚Äù features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not hard to imagine an entire media ecosystem available ‚ÄúOnly on Apple Vision‚Äù. Strong Apple TV+ play here too, possibly. Apple plays long games so this is probably many years out.</p>

              <p>The last published post to this blog was in August 2020. Before then, I was writing daily for almost two years. The habit has to be rebuilt, starting with this short post.</p>

<p>The world is a different place. COVID is relentless and the vaccines are a miracle. Feels like everyone‚Äôs lost someone to this virus. And yet, optimism is abundant. Especially if you‚Äôre building software.</p>

<p>The relationships we‚Äôre building at ‚Äòwork‚Äô and ‚Äòschool‚Äô are happening in software first, and in real life second (or not at all). It‚Äôs a good time to help humans to do more on the internet, and there‚Äôs so much to explore.</p>

<p>And because of this change, the day is regimented by our identity, not a daily commute to an office. Life just feels more <strong>fluid</strong>.</p>

              Triggering &#39;Flow&#39; State
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is the first post in months. I‚Äôm working on a bigger essay right now, but I‚Äôve missed publishing on this space. This is a short post is about how to trigger Flow state, and is a summary of <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth-lab/how-to-reach-flow-state-using-10-flow-state-triggers-473aa28dc3e5">this article</a> by Jari Roomer. This is especially relevant now, when people are working and learning in enviroments not initially created for productivity.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> is a state of complete immersion in whatever activity someone is doing; often signalled by losing complete track of time. You know when it happens, but it <em>can</em> be triggered. This article provides ten ways that contribute to flow state.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eliminate all <em>external</em> distractions: put your phone away, turn off notifications.</li>
  <li>Eliminate internal distractions. This is tougher but meditation and journalling help to clear the mind. Most imporantly, don‚Äôt try to enter flow state when stressed.</li>
  <li>Work at your Biological Peak Time (BPT). Don‚Äôt fight it if you naturally get fatigued at a certain time of day.</li>
  <li>Listen to the right kind of music. Repetitive, non-vocal music, that stretches for an extended period of time.</li>
  <li>Work on one very specific task. Entering flow state with a list of things to do won‚Äôt work. Pick a task.</li>
  <li>The task must be challenging enough, but not TOO challenging. If it‚Äôs too difficult, it will create stress and will be difficult to reach flow (see #2)</li>
  <li>Have a clear outcome or goal. When you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre working towards, you don‚Äôt know when to finish, and procrastination loves it when this lack of clarity exists - it will push you towards quitting earlier.</li>
  <li>Strategically consume caffeine. 200mg per day max (each cup is about 96mg). 400mg creates anxiety.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated. Not surprising but lack of hydration leads to a distracted state of mind.</li>
  <li>Create a mental cue. A special sentence, action that you repeat <em>every</em> time you want to enter flow state.</li>
</ol>

              The New Course, or The Atomic Unit of Digital Schools
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The first generation of online courses focused on the structured delivery of [mostly] video content, sometimes with accompanying materials.</p>

<p>Today, the structure of online courses is so much more, and some of the more successful ones I‚Äôve seen have common elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They all come with a supportive community of peers learning the same thing. Whether it‚Äôs a Slack group or Discourse forum, what you‚Äôre learning is just as important as <em>who you‚Äôre learning with</em>.</li>
  <li>They center around the instructor first, not the content. Twitter is an incredible learning platform because the act of Following is an indication of interest. Some people join courses today because the relationship with the course content starts with their connection with the instructor. Traditionally, you choose a course topic and then get introduced to the instructor.</li>
  <li>They encourage public accountability. The act of creating things in public (through writing and other creative fields) creates a natural skin-in-the-game.</li>
  <li>Built in status through exclusivity. Being a part of a (sometimes) restricted community creates a feeling of exclusivity. Completing the course and being a part of the alumni network carries social status too, just in the same way graduating from a university would.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, moving to a default digital space in education means we‚Äôre seeing a lot of the shared support structures around courses that a ‚Äúschool‚Äù would provide be available to every course itself. It‚Äôs an interesting shift.</p>

              On Twitter and Passive Learning (Updated)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Yesterday I had a conversation with a friend about new tools enabling ‚Äòpassive learning‚Äô - non-traditional platforms that facilitate learning through your existing media diet. For example, <a href="http://www.arist.co">Arist</a>, which delivers learning content through regular text messages. Others optimize for moments of heightened curiosity in any subject, instead of a fixed curriculum based progression. Browser extensions like <a href="http://www.usefluent.co">UseFluent</a>, and <a href="http://www.jointoucan.com">Toucan</a> are examples of this. Each platform affordance creates for different modes of storytelling and recall.</p>

<p>And while these platforms are really interesting, Twitter is the biggest passive learning platform in the world.</p>

<p>It creates a new learning modality not possible before - the consistent exposure to discussions amongst experts and those learning from experts. Anytime I‚Äôm interested in a topic, following Twitter users from that subcommunity or topic is a great way to immerse myself.</p>

<p>It also creates a natural graduation from passive to active learning through the forms of interaction - reading tweets, participating in conversations, creating new tweets about the topic. The exercise of doing everything in public creates a natural skin in the game for learning.</p>

<p>Although it‚Äôs primarily a social platform (can be performative, not always a safe space) - it‚Äôs ability to create a natural learning experiences is pretty interesting.</p>

<p>UPDATE: A <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1265875306901934081">tweet from Naval</a> today reminded me of how lists can be used to shape Twitter into a learning platform vs. a social platform. You can create lists around experts in your areas of interest - and Twitter allows you (on mobile) to add them as additional tabs besides your primary feed. Really cool and underused capability.</p>

              How it Feels

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>It‚Äôs been too long since I‚Äôve posted. There are entire <em>categories</em> of uncertainty I‚Äôm planning for in other parts of life. I‚Äôve also been working on a longer essay on the rapid digitization of school and work. I‚Äôve missed this space, as my days feel incomplete without some kind of creative output.</p>

<p>Felt apt to start again by chronicling how it all feels. Since my last post, the virus spread is continuing. Many countries have managed to flatten the curve and places like Singapore have even stopped a second outbreak. But it continues is some of the larget countries. China is going back into lockdown. Brazil‚Äôs leadership is completely ignoring the virus and will quickly take over the US in cases. The US just crossed 100,000 deaths, more than the lives lost in Vietnam. India‚Äôs cases are rising, despite strict lockdowns and contact tracing infrastructure.</p>

<p>So, this isn‚Äôt over. Not even close.</p>

<p>We are back in Canada after a few months in New York, putting that life adventure on pause. Healthy, content, and planning for the future.</p>

<p>My daily routine has evolved. I‚Äôm up earlier, working out and meditating more. But the workday is intense. I‚Äôve also noticed people are becoming very, very tired of this shit. The burden on everyone is huge and parents have a unique set of challenges. Most schools have cancelled the school year. Knowledge workers around the world are becoming accustomed to a digital by default workday. Childcare is becoming a real issue for families that are balancing it all.</p>

<p>Over and above anything else I‚Äôm thinking of the opportunities around us. Moving our spaces of learning and working into a digital space <em>by default</em> is probably the biggest societal change I might ever witness.</p>

              <p>A common refrain when building new products is to build painkillers, not vitamins. It‚Äôs a way of saying - build products that solve a real problem for users. One they are familiar with, and hate dealing with.</p>

<p>Sometimes this is obvious - they will tell you their pain, and it will be obvious. Most times it‚Äôs not and takes investigation - through conversation, and the learning from building products that <em>don‚Äôt</em> work quite as well.</p>

<p>Innovating from first principles is an exercise in serving a customer need, with the best tools available to you at the time. This cycle takes many years and many companies die in the effort. Some can do it once, but very few can do it again and again.</p>

              A New System (Updated)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The world is at home and facing the reality that the school year is going to end without students returning to classrooms. Despite this, learning hasn‚Äôt stopped. Quite the opposite. And this new reality is revealing cracks in our existing education system.</p>

<p>Some thoughts on what‚Äôs going on and predictions on what might happen, across different stages‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>K-12 systems will like return in a physical form, driven by the need for a safe haven for children while parents are working. Public K-12 is government funded, so the system will only meaningfully change if that investment can respond to the needs of students. We will likely see a rise in homeschooling and privatized education at lower costs, to make up for the inadequate public schooling system.</li>
  <li>For systems of higher education, there will be a few key changes. First, the move to digital delivery will bring down the price of getting a ‚Äòpremium‚Äô education. That‚Äôs only the first of many other n-th order effects here. Second, we‚Äôll see more innovation in schools providing certainty of a successful career (most schools have been training people for the wrong thing). Everything from financing (ISA‚Äôs) to companies offering education credits as part of work. This will see the notion of school and working becoming interleaved.</li>
  <li>We‚Äôll see a rise in platforms targeted at self directed learners - students that want to define their own curiculum and learn at their own pace. ‚ÄúK-12‚Äù and ‚Äúhigher education‚Äù are simply labels and remnants of the past system.</li>
  <li>For those already in the workforce, there will be a massive need on upskilling and reskilling to participate in the knowledge economy. For others, it‚Äôs a time to take back control, and start building their own communities and businesses online.</li>
  <li>In a knowledge economy, long term capital success is directly tied to the ability for companies to build intellectual moats. The best companies are learning organizations and feel like learning communities. The tools that help us in this process will go beyond communication - they will help us organize our thoughts, compound our collective knowledge and help us in the journey of learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly there is a new system being created, and more change is quickly approaching.</p>

              Outlining an Essay On Learning
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This post is highly unstructured. It is a set of questions and thoughts for a broader essay on how broader technological advancement plays out in education and work.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To understand the future we should look into the past. How did the current K-12 and college come to be? What was the innovation that drove the creation of these institutions? What can we learn from those forces, if anything. Detail some of the forces of government, religion and industry have played defining roles in the formation and purpose of some of the world‚Äôs ‚Äòtop‚Äô schools.</li>
  <li>Let‚Äôs dive into the relationship between industry and education. How have they played a role in the past, and how do these forces drive each other. Look into the major revolutions - agricultural, industrial and information.</li>
  <li>In the knowledge economy, education and work are tied together much more closely than prior revolutions. In the past - education was theory and work was practical. Now, those worlds are intertwined. Learning never stops, and the application is fundamental to the learning experience. These facts reinforce the connection:
    <ul>
      <li>Companies are playing increasing roles in supporting the student journey (from the rise in co-operative education, ISA‚Äôs, to company sponsored education). Examples of this are Lambda, Holberton, Springboard.</li>
      <li>Companies are learning machines that produce capital and knowledge. They behave like learning communities. In the past, the knowledge of company operation could be managed by a small group of executives. Now, there is so much knowledge being created at all levels that acting on business knowledge is required at all levels.</li>
      <li>The tools of learning are shared with the tools of working. What we do to compound information, individually and in teams, play roles in achieving student outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As education and work become more intertwined, credentialism doesn‚Äôt just belong to the education sector. A 5 year stint at Google may be more respected and lead to better economic outcomes than a Harvard degree. But it goes beyond that. We have to recognize that learning is a lifelong journey and people acquire skills throughout their life - and our credential system looks less like a diploma mounted on a wall. It looks a set of badges representing skills both learned and applied. There is an interesting opportunity to turn every college degree into a set of badges, and solve the global credentialling crisis where credit isn‚Äôt recognized across borders.</li>
  <li>We are seeing a micro-ization of work and education. The rise of the gig economy is allowing people to diversify their income streams. Self directed workers, the micro-entrepreneurs. The availability of online resources making self directed learning impossibly easy. Instead of spending years at school and then years at work, people have started time dividing their careers into smaller chunks. 8 years seems like a lifetime at a company.</li>
  <li>This is not a zero sum game - the existing education system will always have a role to play, but the rise of a new system will allow for self directed learners and workers. This brings opportunity to support this infrastructure as well.</li>
</ul>

              <p>The education software industry today can roughly be divided into two camps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Software that enables the delivery of educational material over the internet (e.g. Coursera, Skillshare).</li>
  <li>Software that enables the operation of schools and universities (e.g. Tophat).</li>
</ol>

<p>Put even more critically, both camps fall into the category of software that recreates in-person educational experiences. Software is a perfect innovation space for rapid experimentation, and it has been underleveraged for education.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm interested in what happens when we approach this problem from first principles - breaking things down to their essential truths and building upwards. In this case, the essential truths are students desire to learn and achieve a specific outcome.</p>

<p>Everything else can and probably should change.</p>

<p>I think we still have a ways to go to create <em>software native</em> educational experiences - ones have no physical equivalents at all and simply cannot exist without software itself.</p>

<p>What stood out for me, naturally, was the emphasis on education, in reference to where there a smug complacency - a ‚Äúsatisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn‚Äôt that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we‚Äôve been doing education research that‚Äôs never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why haven‚Äôt we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?</p>

              Understanding the Education Industry
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been immersed in the world of online education for the last few months, and have been learning a lot of about the industry. I‚Äôm doing that in a number of ways, that can¬†probably be used to better understand any industry.</p>

<p>To understand the current state of the industry:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading the most recommended books on the state of Education. I‚Äôve started compiling an <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3V2B7L3PGGOQ0">Amazon wishlist</a>.</li>
  <li>Talking to industry leaders to understand their understanding of the first principles of the industry, and understand the story of their organizaitons growth.</li>
  <li>Spend time in meta-learning - learning how to best learn the space - by understanding the key nodes in the education system and how they interact with each other.</li>
  <li>Talking to all participants in the value chain, but starting with end users because their demand fuels everything downstream.</li>
  <li>Visualize and write about the way the system works - how one group of organizations creates customers for another, or the flow of dollars from one company to another.</li>
  <li>Going through the app stores for the category - it helps understand what exists to day to solve some of the core problems in the industry.</li>
  <li>Follow leaders in the space on Twitter to get a better sense of current problems, concerns and how the industry is connected to each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>To understand where the future is going:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding where venture deals are happening in the industry (and talking to foremost VC‚Äôs that invest in the space), which helps to understand where innovation is happening.</li>
  <li>Talk to founders of new and existing startups in that space, at all stages from pre-seed to late-stage.</li>
</ul>

              Some Thoughts on Opportunities in EdTech
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This post is a set of raw and disconnected thoughts on some of the biggest opportunities in ed-tech, somewhat as a continuation of yesterday‚Äôs post.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The line between education and work will continue to blur. Career outcomes will be tied more closely to education, creating a flywheel for a stronger partnership between the world of education and industry. We‚Äôll see more students have their education subsidized by the companies they will one day work for. When joining the workplace, learning and development will play an even stronger role in retaining employees.</li>
  <li>The tools that knowledge workers use to communicate, collect and compound knowledge will play an interesting parallel role with edtech. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how this will manifest but tools like Roam Research are useful for anything from scientific research and the workplace.</li>
  <li>There will be a network that emerges for project based learners to come together to share their work and process. There is a massive demand for people to see other‚Äôs creative process in progress, and for those that are working on things to learn and collaborate with other creators.</li>
</ul>

<p>This set of thoughts will continue to evolve, but one thing seems to be clear: it‚Äôs an exciting time to be building education software products.</p>

              The New Normal for Education
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Things will never be the same, there will be a <em>new normal</em>. People say this a lot these days. The shock of a global months long lockdown is too intense for our social norms to revert, and economy will take a different shape too. This post is an exploration of how our education systems will change post-virus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In preschools - our attitudes towards daycare will change. Daycares are necessary for working parents despite being known as a disease vector. Post-COVID, this will change and many parents will choose in-home pre-schooling options.</li>
  <li>In K-12 and college - distance learning capabilities will be a fundamental requirement for all schools and boards - to the point where we will question what the school day looks like, and what value coming to school actually has for students. It will fundamentally change every students schedule.</li>
  <li>The explosion in MOOC‚Äôs will lead to the demand for the curator / aggregator of the best courses.</li>
  <li>The realm of education and work will continue to come together. Education will not be considered a discrete phase in someone‚Äôs life. We‚Äôll see that distance learning and remote work will make it easier for someone to manage their days so that they may spend half the day working, and another half earning a degree. This is an interesting concept and probably deserves it‚Äôs own post.</li>
  <li>Massive unemployment will require an appropraite sized retraining of people to become a part of the knowledge economy. This seems like a tremendously large opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôll keep adding to this list as more thoughts on this topic develop.</p>

              All Apps Expand Until They Include Video Chat
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A few days ago I played poker with some friends on an app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poker-face-live-texas-holdem/id1364570884">Pokerface</a>. This is what it looked like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pokerface.jpg" alt="poker" /></p>

<p>Like many people, I have started using video chat throughout the day - much more so than before - for work and to connect with people during these strange times. I‚Äôve started see video chat becoming a more prevalant feature in many different types of apps, and it reminded me of direct messaging a few years ago.</p>

<p>In 2013 LukeW <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1696">wrote</a> a variation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski">Law of Software <em>Envelopment</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every mobile app attempts to expand until it includes chat. Those applications which do not are replaced by ones which can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Benedict Evans made this famous in 2015 <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/3/24/the-state-of-messaging">in a blog post</a> about the state of messaging. At this time, Twitter, Instagram and even the app I worked on - Wattpad - included messaging as a core feature.</p>

<p>The same thing is happening now with video chat, and it‚Äôs being accelerated by social distancing.</p>

<p>I predict a new wave of social centric apps built with video as another layer of interaction. Existing apps like online dating and networking will add video - possibly as a layer between messaging and meeting in person. Chat will graduate to video chat (a bit more intimate but equally safe), and that will graduate to an in person meeting.</p>

<p>Other apps will start add a video layer too - on top of content, games, and even utilities. All apps will expand until they include video chat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many people are experiencing, for the first time, how many activities ‚Äî work, learning, healthcare, and socializing ‚Äî can be done remotely and in new ways using digital tools. For sure, when the dust settles, we will largely go back to doing things how we‚Äôve always done them, but I suspect that certain new behaviors will stick, and will result in longer-term behavioral and economic changes.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The first is managing losses. This will be the most difficult and painful thing you do as a CEO because it involves people, but it‚Äôs often not so much about the what as it is the how. Your empathy and speed are key here.</li>
    <li>The second is gaining ground. These are the ways you will reorient your focus, your tactics, and your team so you come out ahead after a crisis.</li>

              <p>Overnight, companies and entire industries have been forced to digitize themselves. All the digital transformation efforts have gone from multi-year projects to getting done at lightning speed.</p>

<p>For some this means digital is driving their entire business - they are now product companies whether they like it or not. Revenue from digital products, or online commerce, has now become their sole source of income, and they are doubling down and building more of what‚Äôs working.</p>

<p>Others have purely operational challenges - overnight they have to enable employees to work from home just to keep business going. Enabling remote work went from being a nice-to-have to a critical function. These setups are here to stay.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever witnessed a change so large, so quickly.</p>

              The Antifragile Startup

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The last 10 years saw the rise of lean startups - emphasizing learning about customers over anything else. It begins by starting with a customer problem, really understanding why people are using your product, and then building the minimum viable product to solve that problem.</p>

<p>In the next few years, I predict we will see the rise of The Antifragile Startup. Antifragility is not simply resilience. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better with chaos and volatility.</p>

<p>Perhaps these are the same thing. Failing fast is one of the tenets of antifragility. But leanness implies an overdose of efficiency - and antifragility is the opposite of that.</p>

<p>Antifragile companies pass the simple test of antifragility: ‚Äúanything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.‚Äù While I‚Äôm not sure what kinds of companies fall under this category yet, I suspect many more are thinking about how their startups can natively turn chaos into opportunity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saving an airline, therefore, should not equate to subsidizing their shareholders and highly compensated managers and promote additional moral hazard in society. For the very fact that we are saving airlines indicates their role as utility. And if as such they are necessary for society, then why do their managers have optionality? Are civil servants on a bonus scheme? The same argument must also be made, by extension, against indirectly bailing out the pools of capital, like hedge funds and endless investment strategies, that are so exposed to these assets; they have no honest risk mitigation strategy, other than a trained na√Øve reliance on bailouts or what‚Äôs called in the industry the ‚Äúgovernment put‚Äù.</p>

  <li>Hardtech infrastructure around transportation and climate. A massive investment by the government in developing infrastructure will lead to projects like high speed air and high speed rail - and all the technology + software that supports it will become extremely valuable.</li>

              The Bull Case and The Bear Case
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The <strong>Bull Case</strong> is that we will quickly find a vaccine to this virus. It will help to prevent the spread, and also cure most existing patients. The curve will not be flattened - it will be smashed entirely. While we wait for the cure to be distributed, a global response to the test, track, quarantine strategy will be enough to contain the virus and get businesses back after a hiatus. The ‚Äúright‚Äù businesses will go out of businesses (e.g. the large leveraged hedge funds). Government bailouts and relief packages will be enough to manage the disruption in our daily lives. The economy will return back to a new normal - a better normal - one in which we will see new opportunities and working paradigms that increase our global economic output. As Ben Hunt puts it, this will be <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/tick-tock/">our finest hour</a>. Coming together as a global community on this will have second order effects for other similar problems, like the climate crisis.</p>

<p>The <strong>Bear Case</strong> is that the virus will kill <em>millions</em> globally, as medical infrastructures crumble under pressure. The fear of another virus will be treated like the new fear of a nuclear fallout. It will justify governments to fund the new biological surveillance state - tracking people‚Äôs heartbeats, temperatures and movement through a host of consumer wearable products - all under the premise of containing <em>the next outbreak</em>. The economic fallout will be swift and last long. Life as we know it no long exists. Industries like tourism will collapse, as will automotives and airlines. Many startups spending recklessly and chasing future possibilities of revenue will go out of business. Unfortunately governments will do what governments always do - save the big companies and hope there will be trickle down effects to the general population. This won‚Äôt happen, and there will be massive unemployment, followed by pockets of civil unrest (as history has shown). And this doesn‚Äôt account for the re-emergence of this or another virus.</p>

<p>This post has been a thought exercise.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm optimistic that we will find our way close to the bull case, but am <em>prepared</em> for the bear case.</p>

<p>There are two broad narratives at play right now: how to stop the virus, and how to manage the fallout.</p>

<p>Stopping the virus is a global discourse about ways to prevent its spread, the capacity of the healthcare system, vaccines and the like. In this narrative, there are parallel tracks of progress to do everything from in-home testing to speedier drug testing. This virus is horrible. But it‚Äôs heartening to see science and scientists on primetime, and to witness knowledge sharing without the fear of retribution.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm trying to stay positive about this - there are countless examples, the President of the United States included - who are spreading scientific disinformation. Lies are costing lives, as Om <a href="https://om.co/2020/03/15/lies-cost-lives/">wrote recently</a>.</p>

<p>The second narrative is about how to manage the fallout. The fallout is a way to encompass the n-th order effects of the virus. The virus has forced schools to shutdown, leaving many students who depended on a daily meal to be left without one. At the same time, parents are forced to stay at home, losing jobs, not being able to pay rent. Downstream, this touches everything. Bailouts and temporary relief packages will only do so much. The world is stopping, and through that we see how our economic machine works. Through this, we can see what pieces are the most critical to build back up.</p>

<p>The unfortunate truth is that process will be slow. COVID‚Äôs economic effects may cause just as much, if not more, suffering and death as the disease itself.</p>

<p>For my family, friends and myself - we‚Äôve been lucky so far. But the world is changing around us.</p>

              <p>A few disconnected thoughts on video conferencing as the after a week working remotely like the rest of the world.</p>

<p>First, the whole process of ‚Äúdialing into‚Äù a video call feels archaic - like the dialup era of the internet. It‚Äôs incredibly powerful once you‚Äôre on, but the process of getting on a call feels like unncessary friction.</p>

<p>The broadband era of the internet meant no dialup was necessary, and this needs to happen in video too. As soon as I want to be on the call, I and everyone should just already <em>be there</em>.</p>

<p>In this new world, we will be always on, always streaming. Switching conversations / contexts should be as easy as opening a different browser tab.</p>

<p>Our video conferencing apps will become as important as our web browsers are today. In an era of remote first, ‚Äúsocial‚Äù is not a feature - but must be the core of communication medium itself. Social first and by default, and content layered on top if needed. Our current browsers are the opposite - social is a ‚Äútype‚Äù of content.</p>

<p>We may look back at Zoom (and the like) in the same way we looked back to the browsers of the early 1990‚Äôs.</p>

<p>This will only be possible when the global internet infrastructure can support massive scale concurrent socket video connections for every internet user. But we may not be too far off from this possibility.</p>

<p>Of course, privacy is a primary level user concern here. It is not easy to become comfortable with the fact that there is a persistent video in the same way we became comfortable with a persistent internet connection. The right controls and opt-out functionality is necessary. Similar to web browsers.</p>

<p>On a related note - as people lose trust in centralized social platforms, your browser being the home of your social interaction - giving you full autonomy and control - makes even more sense.</p>

<p>This is a developing set of thoughts and I‚Äôll be revisiting this soon.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Many thoughts are racing so this is post is going seem more erratic than normal.</p>

<p>A few things are clear at this point. We are witnessing a demarcation point in modern society. That sounds grandiose but ‚Äúpre-virus‚Äù and ‚Äúpost-virus‚Äù are going to our generation‚Äôs equivalent to ‚Äúpre-war‚Äù and ‚Äúpost-war‚Äù.</p>

<p>This is too big of a stimulus to the system for things to return back to normal. Some predictions, large and small:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>More than ever people are willing to try out the ‚Äúonline version of X‚Äù, whether that is education, fitness, events, etc. When they can‚Äôt have the physical thing at all, they will have to suffice with the digital version. In some of these cases, the digital version of X will be ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for people to continue using them. In others, they may return to old patterns if they are still available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Zoom and Twilio Video API‚Äôs will become as powerful as the FB platform. Whether it‚Äôs DJ sets or TED talks, these platforms will power video streaming live events and it will become one of the most valuable companies in tech.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any form of information transfer that requires physical contact - swiping credit cards or pressing elevator buttons - will become contactless. We will see a ton of innovation in human computer interfaces in these situations (voice, etc).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect to write (and read) many more posts of people wrongly predicting the future, just like this one :)</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp">Black Swan Events</a>: A black swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences.

  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_distribution">Fat Tails</a>: A fat-tailed distribution is a probability distribution that exhibits a large skewness relative to that of either a normal distribution or an exponential distribution.

  <li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp">Modern Portfolio Theory</a> is how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward.

  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory">Systems Theory</a>, the interdisciplinary study of systems.

              <p>As I write this, the Dow is hovering at about 8% off yesterday‚Äôs close, Twitter is buzzing with conversations about Coronavirus and the economy. The volatility index (VIX) is spiking.</p>

<p>I happen to follow a lot of investors on Twitter. The consistent narrative is that we are headed to into an unprecedented territory, potentially the fastest bear market in history.</p>

<p>I wanted to record what this feels like, because like many others I‚Äôm exposed to this risk. As of now, I‚Äôm not too worried (this may come back to bite me later). Mainly because what I‚Äôm holding is what I would‚Äôve held anyways and will want to hold for a long time. And simply now I can get more for cheaper.</p>

<p>But it definitely feels surreal to be watching what will definitely be written about in the financial history books. This will spark financial theories, and people will likely study this time for generations. As things are happening I‚Äôll be using this space to document how I‚Äôm thinking about these changes.</p>

              <p>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the rise in remote work because of the COVID-19 situation globally. While a lot of people are talking about the rise of video conferencing, I think our next biggest problem is going to be how we help teams of people to collectively compound knowledge now that everyone is default not in physical proximity.</p>

<p>This problem exists today, but physical proximity makes it easier to resolve. You can see a person and say, yeah, hey they know about this, go talk to them. Remote makes that a bit more difficult. Social norms online don‚Äôt allow for consistent interruption. There‚Äôs a need for a tool that helps teams share their knowledge together.</p>

              <p>Remote work is seeing a real moment these days. But, in a knowledge economy on the internet, physical proximity doesn‚Äôt really make sense as the default. Working in the samne office is definitely beneficial to promote creative group work. But, my prediction is that is more of a bug than a feature. The tools to create a feeling of promixity are going to get better with more use, and we will be able to have the same high bandwidth conversations online (video, VR will help).</p>

<p>The term ‚Äúremote‚Äù makes it sound like you are away from the conversation too. With the internet, it makes it seems a bit strange that a physical location is the central place of work, and the decentralized environment where everything is available is considered ‚Äúremote‚Äù. I think we‚Äôll see people switch to remote work being the <em>default</em>, and coming into work will be reserved for special occasions. Many companies have been doing this for years and I expect this to become a new social norm.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Compensation is a sensitive topic. We think about it often but don‚Äôt discuss it openly. This informaton asymmetry creates silos where a few people are in ‚Äúthe know‚Äù, and many others are seemingly left out. Often because they‚Äôre not asking the right questions, don‚Äôt know who to ask, or simply - are not sure how to start the conversation.</p>

<p>I had one of these conversations recently, and I offered some advice to a friend. This post summarizes some of my thoughts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Do your homework. Understand comparables and what is fair for your industry and level, and set your own expectations accordingly. Make sure you are equipped with this prior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Own the conversation, don‚Äôt wait for it or let it happen to you. Compensation conversations often happen too late so it‚Äôs best to bring up your expectations earlier in your job search.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no ‚Äúdeals‚Äù. I‚Äôve found the best compensation conversations end with a feeling that this is the beginning of a strong partnership, versus one side feeling they got the better or worse end of a deal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use an intermediary if it makes you more comfortable. Using a recruiter has the advantage of avoiding direct confrontation. I‚Äôve found this to be useful, but also see a lot of value in directness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undertstand that there‚Äôs so much more than base. Negotiate along multiple lines - base, upside and downside. You want a base with a good savings rate buffer,  to maximize your upside, and to minimize any downside risks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure your base covers living comfortably, with a good buffer for savings. My target was 60-70% of my base should cover my living expenses - including mortgages / nannies etc. The rest would go into savings. I think in a world where pensions are not the norm, a 30-40% savings rate should be considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Life circumstances become a good negotiation lever - it‚Äôs hard to push back on. New houses, kids, parents to support, all that helps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maximize your upside (equity, bonuses etc) - make sure you‚Äôre able to participate in the long term success of the company. In startupworld, equity is the name of the game but I think we‚Äôll soon see different forms of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long_term_incentive-plan.asp">long term equity compensation</a>. Long term bonus and equity are more difficult than any other category to negotiate when you‚Äôre in the job, so doing this upfront is important. You can negotiate the ‚Äúoption to reevaluate‚Äù any part of this if the company doesn‚Äôt have formal performance planning and associated compensation adjustments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minimuze your downside - Make sure you have severance included. This is your only time to negotiate your severance package. It can be an uncomfortable discussion but they expect it to happen but never bring it up. You have to do this yourself, and it‚Äôs a good signal. It‚Äôs standard to ask for at least 9-12 months.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôll be adding to this as more thoughts arise on this topic.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Coronavirus has spread into our conversations faster than the virus itself. Markets are spooked and grocery lineups are getting longer. The virus is here, and as we ramp up detection we‚Äôll find out how prevalant it is (and perhaps has been for weeks).</p>

<p>The fear will start in communities globally based on the news of the virus. But it will likely subside while the virus continues to spread globally and becomes another part of our everyday life. The fear and the virus will spread independent of each other.</p>

<p>There is already a clear economic impact, but not all effects will be negative. I‚Äôm thinking particularly about the dramatic drop in air pollution, and dramatic rise of remote working policies. COVID-19 might be the moment we pause and re-evaluate how we‚Äôre going about our lives - and make the right changes in response.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I recently heard about LED wall technology through <a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1234160439660953601">this Twitter thread</a>, about The upcoming Bourne Stuntacular at Universal uses a giant LED wall as background, and it‚Äôs synchronized perfectly with stunt actors and props in the foreground. The result is a cinema quality production that‚Äôs playing out in front of viewers eyes.</li>
  <li>This is also the same way that Star Wars Mandalorian was shot. ILM recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUnxzVOs3rk">showcased</a> how dramatically this changed the production process. Unreal Engine also showcased LED walls in use in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bErPsq5kPzE">this Youtube video</a>.</li>
  <li>The impact of LED wall technology has the potential to make complex production techniques more accessible. This will dramatically impact the financial structure of big budget filmmaking.</li>

              <p>Some notes on the broader trend of turning more assets into financial instrument:</p>

<p>Any asset that has increasing value over time is being packaged as a financial instrument, to allow for more people to participate in that value increase. This is happening in traditional categories like <a href="https://www.withotis.com/">art</a>, but also with <a href="https://edly.info/">new students entering the workforce</a>.</p>

<p>This exercise is not different from securitization, in which different forms of contractual debt is repackaged as bonds or CDO‚Äôs.</p>

<p>This trend feels like something that can only occur in a booming market cycle, when investors are looking for new opportunities to generate wealth. This seems to be coming to an end. I‚Äôm not spelling doom and gloom for these new innovative ‚Äòasset classes‚Äô - I think investors will generally skew towards fewer abstractions and increased certainty.</p>

              Notes on &#39;Debt is Coming&#39;
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p><a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/">Alex Danco‚Äôs article</a> on debt from a few weeks ago made a lot of rounds. I‚Äôve finally read it and I‚Äôm using this post as a way of summarizing some notes on the topic.</p>

<p>This post starts by exploring the relationship between financial capital, or FK (money used for investments like equity) and production capital, or PK (money used for producing real goods and services).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There‚Äôs a recurring dynamic of how FK and PK perceive each other and work with one another. Jerry Neumann‚Äôs explanation is good: ‚ÄúMy long-ago operations research textbook had a cartoon showing one MBA talking to another: ‚ÄòThings? I didn‚Äôt come here to learn how to make things, I came here to learn how to make money.‚Äô This is the view of financial capital. The view of production capital is exemplified by Peter Drucker: ‚ÄòSecurities analysts believe that companies make money. Companies make shoes.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FK is deployed into companies that use it for PK. In early stage of any technology where potential is unknown, venture capital is the prevailing model to follow here. A small number of those deployed bets will produce outsized returns.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new technology is exciting, and the market opportunities are large but unknown. Speculative investment, with ambitious but inexact expectations of financial return, is important fuel for founders who build the unknown future. However, investors and operators are often deeply misaligned: investors think in bets, while operators think in consequences. The relationship is tense, but can be explosively productive. The VC model is an institutional expression of this tension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When technology is widely adopted and then becomes a part of everyday fabric of society, it becomes easier to predict how that technology will be adopted. Therefore, FK can be deployed with an more predictable outcome. VC is not the appropriate model here - but <em>venture debt</em> definitely is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The overall bet may still be speculative, but the median VC dollar isn‚Äôt anymore. It‚Äôs buying customer acquisition and then financing service delivery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This change will start to occur in areas where technology has entered the ‚Äúdeployment phase‚Äù - i.e. mobile. And for founders building those companies, they should consider more options for financing other than VC.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you‚Äôre a tech founder raising capital today, there‚Äôs really one mainstream way to fund it: by selling equity. The VC model capital stack, which the Silicon Valley venture ecosystem has optimized itself around, is the one-size-fits-all funding model for startups of all shapes and sizes. We know it like muscle memory at this point. If your career began after the dot com crash, as mine and I‚Äôm sure many of yours did, you‚Äôve probably never known any other way.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A great source of product ideas comes from daily conversations.</p>

<p>Too often, products are built around <em>perceived</em> problems. Conversations contain unfiltered signal that helps us understand people‚Äôs <em>real</em> problems.</p>

<p>Too often, products are built with a ‚Äúif we build it, they will come‚Äù mentality (despite best intentions of the opposite). Understanding how people recommend products helps build distribution mechanics into a product itself.</p>

<p>User research should always strive towards getting signal that is as close to those daily conversations as possible.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Marketplaces
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Some disconnected thoughts on marketplaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Online marketplaces create demand by bringing previously scarce or untapped supply and making it easily accessible. Focusing on supply is the tried and tested formula for growing marketplaces.</li>
  <li>Once bootstrapped, online marketplaces aggregate demand (users) and allow for suppliers of all types find new business. In this sense, an online marketplace is an MVP for a supplier (driver, merchant, etc) to test whether there is a market for their business. Once that is done, it likely serves them better to own the customer relationship directly. This is to avoid overreliance of their business on any one platform.</li>
  <li>Some marketplaces are resilient to individual suppliers leaving, and are easily substituted. Those are often more transactional and where there is no strong connection between the two sides (i.e. a rider doesn‚Äôt really care who their driver is).</li>
  <li>Some marketplaces are very sensitive to suppliers leaving, and can respond to this by enabling paths for suppliers to be successful both on and off platform.</li>
  <li>Marketplaces can think of themselves as ad networks for influential suppliers, providing better targeting for them and greater reach on platform (and potentially off platform too). This has the double benefit of serving as a source of additional revenue for the marketplace.</li>
  <li>To protect their marketplace, becoming a platform for other businesses to reach their suppliers can create an additional moat for the business. It becomes a one-stop shop for creators, and in addition creates another source of network effects.</li>

              The Right Questions
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Question quality is a good proxy for how well you really understand something. This applies for every discipline, but especially for building products.</p>

<p>In early stages, product discovery often starts with questions for your customer about their attitudes about something. In bad research, the questions are too pointed, even though they might not seem to be on the surface. In good research, the questions invite potential customers to tell a story about themselves. These stories often lead to the ground truth around customer attitudes, and ultimately, their behaviour.</p>

<p>This example from <a href="https://www.producttalk.org/2016/03/customer-interview-questions">Teresa Torres</a> really sums it up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I recently asked a woman what factors she considered when buying a new pair of jeans. She didn‚Äôt hesitate in her answer. She said, ‚ÄúFit is my number one factor.‚Äù</p>

  <p>That seems reasonable. It‚Äôs hard to find a pair of jeans that fit well.</p>

  <p>I then asked her to tell me about the last time she bought a pair of jeans. She said, ‚ÄúI bought them on Amazon.‚Äù</p>

  <p>I laughed and asked, ‚ÄúHow did you know if they fit?‚Äù</p>

  <p>She said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt, but they were a brand I liked and they were on sale.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There‚Äôs a huge difference between what people say and what people do. Good research should always try to get towards the latter.</p>

              <p>A very short post today. I started readiing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484">Range</a> last night, and enjoyed this last paragraph from the introduction. The reference is to the approach taken by Tiger Woods versus Roger Federer. The former specialized in golf since he demonstrated a childhood aptitude for the sport, and the latter dabbled in skiing, wrestling, swimming, skateboarding - all while he played tennis. Both became the best in the world at their sports.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization. While it is undoubtedly thrue that there are areas that require individuals with Tiger [Woods]‚Äô precocity and clarity of purpose, as complexity increases - as technology spins the world into vaster webs of interconnected systems in which each individual only sees a small part - we also need more Roger [Federers]: people who start broad and ebrace diverse experiences while they progress.</p>

              Retention Learnings
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Had a really great conversation yesterday about how to think about retention problems in consumer apps. My experience is primarily with consumer, mobile-first, media &amp; content centric products (music, reading, social). This post is a way to capture some learnings - many of these can be tied back to step function increases .</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Learnings</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Retention isn‚Äôt about any one thing, it‚Äôs about the compounding effects of many small things. To make this possible, any team has to be committed to the exercise of continual experimentation and learning. At Wattpad, our data team pioneered the experiment council - a weekly review of the experiment pipeline, which is still in place today and enforced this discipline. This is a cultural exercise, not a technical one.</li>
  <li>Retention is a growth exercise, which is new, so talk to the best in the game. There are no books on this (yet), but there are very active communities that share best practices. <a href="www.reforge.com">Reforge</a> is a great example (I‚Äôve done an early Reforge course and still refer back to it often).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Product Specific Learnings</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to understand your existing retention patterns and base rates. At Wattpad, we knew we were a multi-day-a-week product, and for every session people spent about 30 minutes. This helped us baseline our experiments and be specific with our goals.</li>
  <li>The world is busy. You need to understand the ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moment of your product, and deliver to people as quickly and as often as possible. This is the moment your product delivers exactly what your users are looking for (and in the best cases, didn‚Äôt know they were looking for).</li>
  <li>If your product enables any kind of user interaction - comments, liking etc - keep that interaction as ‚Äúclose‚Äù to content as possible. The closer it is, the more likely users will engage. In media products, this manifests as in-story comments (Wattpad), in-track comments (Soundcloud). This also happens to create a unique experience that can‚Äôt be replicated by simply moving the content from one place to another.</li>
  <li>Discover is nonlinear and needs to be optimized across channels. People find your product in many ways, don‚Äôt assume content discover is going to happen from your ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù screens. It rarely does.</li>
  <li>Creating rabbit holes of discovery. Youtube‚Äôs biggest source of discovery is the ‚Äúrelated videos‚Äù next to each video. They have spent years optimizing that list to encourage you to continue watching. Today those ‚Äúrelated videos‚Äù aren‚Äôt just related to the video you‚Äôre watching, they are personal recommendations, editorials, ads, etc. A personal note - This method <em>works</em> but as an industry we have to go beyond capturing attention just for the sake of doing it.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt waste the moments in which users are most likely to be happiest - e.g. right after they‚Äôve watched a video, or given a positive rating to some content. That is a potential opportunity to encourage another action (potentially a conversion to being a paid user), or even a simple positive app review.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are only some learnings and I‚Äôll update this as I think of more.</p>

              What a CEO Does
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I often think about Fred Wilson‚Äôs post about <a href="https://avc.com/2010/08/what-a-ceo-does/">what a CEO does</a>. At Wattpad, Allen Lau used to speak of it quite often too. In their words, the three jobs of a CEO are below (in brackets my comments on how they fit the <a href="/20190409/systems-of-impact.html">system of impact</a> model):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set the vision and strategy for the company, and making that clear to everyone (the goals for how products should be adopted in market, and what impact that should create as a whole).</li>
  <li>Hire the right people, and get out of their way (in the <em>system</em>, these are the individuals and teams that build the right product).</li>
  <li>Make sure there‚Äôs enough cash in the bank (this is not represented in the system in it‚Äôs current state, and probably should be).</li>
</ol>

<p>There are no direct paths to any of the above. You cannot set a vision without having some sense of the core first principles or problems you‚Äôre trying to solve. This takes conversation, research and learning. You cannot hire the right people without truly understanding what it means to hire the wrong ones, and learning from it. You cannot keep your company well capitalized without understanding the impact that different sources of capital will have on your company. All of it is a difficult process but the journey is full of learning.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Airbnb (travel) is the largest, capturing 38% of the pie. Food delivery and groceries companies are in the next three positions.</li>
  <li>Some of the fastest growing companies are in surprising categories like  wholesale (e.g Faire) and celebrity engagement (e.g. Cameo). Sneakers and indie goods marketplaces are also growing rapidly but this isn‚Äôt that surprising.</li>
  <li>Some categories are fragmented, others have clear winners. Airbnb is a clear winner in travel - makes sense, given travel is infrequent and choices are zero sum. I‚Äôd imagine it would be the opposite for categories like Food, Education and Shopping.</li>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Software is unique in that the space of designing and developing happen so <em>close</em> to each other. This proximity has led to a rise in designers that develop, and vice versa. The closing gap between the two fields is nothing new. What is cool is the tools of design &amp; development starting to borrow from each other as a result.</p>

<p>Design apps borrow from the world of development with features like <a href="https://www.abstract.com/">version control</a> - and some add the ability to <a href="https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer-x/code-editor/">code itself</a>. Development environments like Xcode have long been very <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/DesigningwithStoryboards.html">design centric</a>. As designers and developers become comfortable using tools that look familiar, this cross functional fluency will increase. The no-code movement will likely also bridge some gaps.</p>

<p>This trend may even result in an altogether new discipline. With this new type of creator comes the need for a new type of creator community. It might look something halfway between Dribbble and Github, creating a space for polymathic designer/developers to learn from each other.</p>

              Computers that Make Commitments
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/27/computers-that-make-commitments/">recent post</a> by Chris Dixon from A16Z explains the Blockchain in simple terms - as computers that make commitments - and the implications of that simple fact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockchains are computers that can make commitments. Traditional computers are ultimately controlled by people, either directly in the case of personal computers or indirectly through organizations. Blockchains invert this power relationship, putting the code in charge. A game theoretic mechanism ‚Äî a so-called consensus mechanism ‚Äî makes blockchains resilient to modifications to their underlying physical components, effectively making them resilient to human intervention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With blockchains, a few things become possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Computer networks have unchangeable data (the chain itself) built into the network itself, not just in an individual computer.</li>
  <li>A computer network itself can behave with a set of rules (not just the individual computers), and therefore be programmed. (e.g. Ethererum)</li>
  <li>Computer networks can have inherent financial instruments (tokens) that can grow in value with the growth of the network itself. (e.g Bitcoin)</li>
</ol>

<p>Extrapolating these three can probably help us explore the different possibilities of how Blockchains will change how we use computers.</p>

              <p>Recently, employees from tech companies from all around the world have been <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KnowYourWorth">posting their salaries</a> on Twitter as part of the #KnowYourWorth campaign. Many of them are early in their careers and skew towards engineering roles.</p>

<p>Besides the information itself, the act of sharing signals changing attitudes towards what has been extremely sensitive in the past. This is a very good sign - information opacity has especially held back minority groups including women and people of color.</p>

<p>I also expect more of this to continue, and products to be built that encourage this behaviour. While Venmo and Paypal have made it easier for people to send and receive money, social finance is still in its early stages. Our attitudes and desires towards money are more nuanced and our products need to reflect that.</p>

I agree with a lot of points but the college system is <em>incomplete</em>, not completely irrelevant. It opens space for a new flavor of learning modality, but my guess is the rumors of the death of college are exagerrated. Some key points from the thread:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Teaching will become an extremely lucrative profession, and salaries will follow a power law.</li>
  <li>Mass market courses will have Hollywood-level production budgets.</li>
  <li>Subjects will cross-pollinate, and students will become more polymathic.</li>
  <li>Education will be cheap, once credentials are out of the hands of just colleges.</li>
  <li>Community learning will make a comeback - creating groups of self motivated learners.</li>
  <li>Students will become producers - they‚Äôll learn by creating, building and doing things.</li>
  <li>School will escape the classroom.</li>
  <li>The future of education looks like Y-Combinator, with respected industry credentials, supporting peers, learning by doing, and top talent.</li>
  <li>Students evaluations will become as meaningful teacher evaluations.</li>
  <li>Online education will invert the learning process, starting with curiousity and moving towards the basics of specifics subjects.</li>
  <li>The best teachers will be practitioners - the industry experts themselves.</li>
</ol>

              Recovering from Distraction

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is a short post exploring <em>attention</em>.</p>

<p>We work in open offices - environments of constant distraction. We carry distraction machines in our pockets and wear them on our wrists. Software has eaten the world and isn‚Äôt stopping, despite a global conversation warning us against it.</p>

<p>In this new environment, the ability to stay focused and recover from distractions is a superpower. This is not a new concept - attention has long been considered the most scarce commodity, and therefore the most valuable. The ability to control our own attention is necessary; the ability to keep <em>others</em> attention is the holy grail.</p>

<p>Much has been written about staying focused; less so on the ability to recover from distraction. The truth is during any given task, getting distracted takes less than a second, where as recovering from it takes minutes, sometimes hours. Our success is proportational to how quickly we can take notice, refocus, and get back into a state of constant flow. Maybe we should focus less on avoiding distraction, and more on reacting to it quickly.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs to fewer distractions and more focus for today.</p>

              <p>I‚Äôve been following the development of <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, a ‚Äúnote-taking tool for networked thought‚Äù. There are a few defining features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As you‚Äôre typing a note, you can surround any word with square brackets and that will create a new note with that word as the topic.</li>
  <li>As you‚Äôre typing and any previously linked word is mentioned, Roam prompts you to link references to that word. This way, all notes can stay constantly linked to each other - creating a feeling of ‚Äúnetworked thought‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Every day, a new dated note is created - a place for streams of consciousness to be linked to individual topic notes.</li>
</ul>

<p>This idea is that Roam becomes a ‚Äòsecond brain‚Äô, a term coined by <a href="https://www.keepproductive.com/blog/how-to-build-a-second-brain">Tiago Forte</a>. There‚Äôs an interesection of ideas between this and asynchronous work that can be applied to teamwork too. I‚Äôll be paying attention to this space closely.</p>

              <p>Startups are learning machines. Their success is a function of how well they acquire new knowledge, and their ability to compound on existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Acquiring new [market] knowledge comes first hand - by launching new products and services and gauging customer response. It can also be acquired through effective market and user research. This feedback loop is visible, and therefore written about more than anything else. It can consume the story of a company but it‚Äôs not the complete picture.</p>

<p>The second factor is how well a company compounds knowledge. This is a function of how well a company can (a) retain information (b) use that information to make continually better decisions for their customers. This comes from a deeper examination of it‚Äôs inner function.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs is so much opportunity to help companies better compound their knowledge. We have tools to help us communicate but they are removed from decision making. We have tools to help us store our knowledge but they are removed from the work itself. And there are very few tools that are help us at a <em>personal level</em> to clarify our thinking amidst all this information.</p>

<p>Software can‚Äôt solve all these problems but things could be much better than where they are today.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I had a great conversation recently with someone about the current state of wellness software (meditation apps etc), and we circled around the concept of intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation.</p>

<p>Intrinsic motivation is the desire to engage in an activity purely for internal satisfaction. In this behaviour, there are no rewards other than enjoyment of the activity itself.</p>

<p>Extrinsic motivation, in comparison, is the desire to do something because of the outcome that will result by doing that task.</p>

<p>In our conversation we discussed how meditation apps were using extrinsic motivators (like streaks and badges) to encourage an activity whose reward really should the <em>activity itself</em>. The same is true for learning apps like Duolingo. As a user of these apps, there was always something that didn‚Äôt quite sit right with the gamification of those experiences. Without intrinsic motivation, streaks and badges aren‚Äôt enough to create learning.</p>

<p>This concept can be applied more broadly for teams and companies too. Put simply - teams that enjoy the act of playing together are more likely to win championships.</p>

              <p>A short reflection on the current state of writing:</p>

<p>In the new year, I‚Äôve tried to keep up with writing everyday - one of the habits that typically anchors my day. But, of the 38 days in the new year, I‚Äôve written 19 posts. It doesn‚Äôt seem that bad on average, but there have been long gaps and most posts haven‚Äôt been original content - mostly short summaries of other interesting articles.</p>

<p>Life got in the way - two kids, a new job and of course the move to New York. The daily intention exists but the morning habit is broken. Nights are when I‚Äôm the least intellectually curious and just want to wind down.</p>

<p>So, the habit has to be rebuilt and I have some catching up to do.</p>

<p>The first principle of media industry is creative expression, delivered to those seeking it. Value is created when this happens successfully. On the surface this looks like streaming services, subscription and advertising models, or licensing deals, and so on.</p>

<p>Education provides a structured path to self development and opportunity. On the surface are the K-12 system, MOOCs, standardized testing, etc.</p>

<p>Transportation is about the movement of people and goods. On the surface are shipping containers, electric cars and ride sharing.</p>

<p>The surface level is what already exists to solve those problems.

  <p>JavaScript. Brendan Eich implemented the first prototype for JavaScript in 10 days, in May 1995. It shipped in beta in September of that year.</p>

  <p>iPod. Tony Fadell was hired to create the iPod in late January 2001. Steve Jobs greenlit the project in March 2001. They hired a contract manufacturer in April 2001, announced the product in October 2001, and shipped the first production iPod to customers in November 2001, around 290 days after getting started.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a simple technique to learn anything by practicing how to explain it to a child. This perspective helps us avoid complicated jargon. Explaining something in simple terms forces us to actually understand the topic at hand.</p>

<p>The technique itself has four steps that can be repeated:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write down your explanation of the topic for a child, without using fancy jargon</li>
  <li>Step 2: Review where you got stuck, and re-learn it in simpler terms.</li>
  <li>Step 3: Organize into a simple narrative you can repeat.</li>
  <li>Step 4 (Optional): Try it with an actual child.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>World After Capital has two goals. The first goal is to establish that we are, in fact, experiencing a third such non-linearity. The key argument is that each prior time the space of the possible expanded dramatically, the binding scarcity constraint for humanity shifted. Specifically, the invention of agriculture shifted scarcity from food to land. Industrialization, in turn, shifted scarcity from land to capital. Now digital technologies are shifting scarcity from capital to attention. Scarcity, here, refers to humanity‚Äôs ability to meet everyone‚Äôs basic needs.</p>

              Lessons from General Magic
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>General Magic is the documentary of the company of the same name. It‚Äôs the story of a special team trying to make a difference building products in the early 90‚Äôs technology industry. I didn‚Äôt expect it to encapsulate almost every modern lesson about building products and companies.</p>

<p>Some notes I took as I was watching:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The importance of an inspiring vision that can both motivate talented people to come work for you, but also doesn‚Äôt require you to over manage every part of how things are done. This is particularly true in early stages when a company is just taking shape.</li>
  <li>The importance of bringing the right people in the room. General Magic employed the most creative and talented people in the industry - part of the reason why it was able to create such an innovative products.</li>
  <li>Related to above - the product monoculture eventually led to their downfall, because while they loved to build, they did so thinking only of themselves as customers vs. their actual target consumer.</li>
  <li>Ignoring the internet - just like Blackberry did when the iPhone came out, General Magic ignored important market signals like the advent and popularity of the internet.</li>
  <li>Open vs. Closed - While General Magic‚Äôs downfall wasn‚Äôt attributed directly to this, the fact is they built a closed network at a time the world was going in the opposite direction.</li>
  <li>The importance of shipping and learning - Towards the end, General Magic was struggling just to get a product out the door. They suffered from the quintessential problem that ‚Äúperfect is the enemy of done.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Building something nobody wanted - Ultimately General Magic failed because of the same reasons most startups today fail - they build something no one actually needed. Engineers ignored user research and built for themselves. Which is why the 3000 devices that were sold were mostly friends and family of General Magic employees.</li>
  <li>Believing your own hype - Inspiring vision can wake you up in the morning but beware of getting too caught up in your own PR. At best it‚Äôs a distraction, at worst it creates a reality distortion field. The latter happened to General Magic.</li>
  <li>Good Management matters - Related to the lesson around shipping - General Magic were great creatives but poor managers. Dates kept getting pushed because of scope creep that didn‚Äôt add any meaningful value.</li>
  <li>Market Timing - Probably one of the most important lessons. General Magic as a company was a failure but the team and the ideas definitely were not. Ultimately the same team manifested the same vision but at a different time.</li>
  <li>Public failure, mental health, and the personal attachment to work. The best part of working in an environment like General Magic is it feels like your life‚Äôs work. The worst part is how closely your identity becomes tied with the success and failures. This can create great anxiety and personal trouble that are hard to recover from. This is true now more than ever.</li>
  <li>The valley‚Äôs signature qualities that make it a great place to start companies - acceptance / celebration of failure, and paying it forward to the next generation.</li>
  <li>The importance of shipping fast and iterating - the iPod shipped a new generation every year (the iPhone is following suit) - a complete departure from the General Magic approach of waiting until everything was perfect.</li>
</ul>

<p>General Magic was one of the original tech ‚Äòmafias‚Äô - the team went on the found and lead some of the most important companies in modern history. All of these lessons ring true today, which is an amazing legacy in itself.</p>

              Lessons from the Early Days of AWS
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In 2002-2003 as a young developer I spent a few internships at Amazon.com. I was strangely interested in the world of mobile apps, which at that time meant writing software for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)">Nokia Series 60 devices</a>. Amazon had a small team called Amazon Anywhere, which reportedly was responsible for bringing Amazon ‚Äúanywhere except the PC‚Äù. This team was responsible for building an API layer around the core Amazon data (at that time it was product information). This API was then abstracted for external consumption and became the very first version of Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>Amazon Anywhere <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-anywhere-not-quite-everywhere/">didn‚Äôt work out</a> as planned, but the technology and team stayed, and I was lucky to be a fly on the wall in those early discussions. Some lessons from that early experience:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The best companies fail differently.</strong> When an initiative or experiment fails, most companies look at that failure in one dimension. They might chalk it up to wrong market timing, or a bad product. The best companies try to understand every part of what didn‚Äôt work, and whether there was any other learning along the way that could lead to more opportunity. In Amazon‚Äôs case, the API they built was found to be a useful thing for internal developers and became a foundational learning for AWS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The best companies understand all the ways they create value</strong>. Amazon‚Äôs API before web services was an internal ‚Äòtool‚Äô to make development more efficient. Most companies look at their internal tools as a way of getting their core work done, and not as a unit of value themselves. Once they realized it <em>was</em> valuable to others, it was abstracted to be externally friendly. That same logic went down the computing stack - and they soon made available their payments platform, storage, compute, and the rest is history. Key lesson - understand that value signals come from everywhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The best companies make long term investments.</strong> AWS in the early days was not a revenue generator. People created websites with AWS powered widgets for things like custom stores, but it wasn‚Äôt clear the overall value for Amazon. It was only in the later days when more parts of the compute stack were exposed that the value became clear. Now AWS is the highest margin business and fastest growing business in Amazon, almost two decades later. Very few companies carry a multi-decade timescale in their minds.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Many of these lessons are still valid today, and there are of course decades of lessons that could be extracted from later stages of AWS.</p>

              <p>I came across this short video from Edutopia today on the importance of inclusivity in classrooms. In tech, we discuss inclusivity as an important way to build better products. It makes sense that the same thinking has been true in pedagogy - the study of teaching and learning - for many years. Check out the video <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/video/building-belonging-classroom">here</a>, and some key excerpts I took from it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The classroom] community becomes a place where you can bring your emotions, fears, needs, and be honest about what‚Äôs going on. And know there will be acceptance and support and love that‚Äôs available to carry you through.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sense of belonging is one of the most important activators of a child‚Äôs engagement in learning. Everything about activating a child‚Äôs cognitive skills begins with activating their social connectedness.</p>

              Life Driven by Network Effects
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>NFX is a venture firm that is focused on companies that have network effects. They also have a great blog and regularly publish interesting stories in the world of tech.</p>

<p>Recently, they published a <a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/your-life-network-effects">post</a> about how network effects drives <em>individuals</em> as much as it drives companies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Working with network effects in our 100+ companies makes it impossible not to notice how the same mechanisms and math that create near-destiny for companies also create near-destiny for us as individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes through seven key networks in a persons life and how network dynamics effect individuals. Those seven ‚Äòcrossroads‚Äô, as they describe them, are below, with some key paragraphs from each section.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What family you‚Äôre born into</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>You go through life thinking such things are innately ‚Äúyou‚Äù. But you didn‚Äôt adopt your identity in a vacuum. Had you been raised by a different family, you would likely be a very different ‚Äúyou‚Äù ‚Äî Your religion, linguistics, political orientation, favorite foods, worldview would probably be very different despite such things not being genetically heritable.</p>

  <p>Your family is a low-friction, high-impact network. Because of that underlying math, when making life decisions most people will choose the options that most align with their core family network. Be aware of this if you want to be more conscious in directing where your life path will lead.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>High school network, where you learn the importance of status.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>High schools are typically the first peer networks we join that are large enough to have a diverse array of subgroups ‚Äî better known as high school cliques. As such, they present us with our first significant network-based decision: who to associate with in high school.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, as your first peer-based network you form after you‚Äôve come of age, your high school friends have a particular influence on your lifelong identity ‚Äî from your tastes in music, to your work ethic, your fashion sense, and your life aspirations ‚Äî which is only rivaled by family, and in some cases even surpasses it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs not just during high school that high school networks matter. Those who go to college and build a career in the same cosmopolitan area as their high school are likely to retain some parts of their teenage cliques throughout their lifetime, usually forming a core part of their network.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>College network, which acts like a trainer in a gym getting you to become <em>your best self</em>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>College is possibly best seen as a place for network formation, and creating the network topology you want. The network you join will lead you to a geography, a type of work, certain ideas about life, and a group of dating/marriage options that will all have a big influence on your life. All that network force will be pushing on you to then take the mathematically obvious path from there, one which will feel like the ‚Äúright decision‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>First job, described as ‚Äúthe seed of your professional network which influences the arc of your career‚Äù</li>

              How to Invest in Startups
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Interesting new post from Sam Altman with advice on <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-invest-in-startups">how to be a good startup investor</a>.</p>

<p>A quick summary of the advice, which in summary form comes across as a very linear process (makes perfect sense since investing is a pipeline driven business).</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Getting access to investment opportunities - through sheer hard work and/or building a unique brand.</li>
    <li>Improving your decision-making on what to invest in. Sam asks himself whether he‚Äôd work for that person as a first step. For founders he looks at scrappiness, speed, and a core belief in themselvs. For markets, he looks at size but importantly growth rates, and whether companies are ahead of the market or riding a strong technology adoption curve.</li>
    <li>Close Rate is an important metric when capital is easier to come by. It‚Äôs a relationship game - you have to be helpful and decisive, and treat founders as peers.</li>
    <li>Stay helpful - Be specific and tactical, make intros, help them hire, find investors, etc. Help them solve real problems. Warn them of big mistakes they‚Äôre about to make (and you‚Äôre sure of it), and stay out of the idea factory. Not your job.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Some key paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The spectral signatures of the best companies I‚Äôve invested in are remarkably similar.  They usually have most of the following characteristics: compelling founders, a mission that attracts talented people into the startup‚Äôs orbit, a product so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about it, a rapidly growing market, a network effect and low marginal costs, the ability to grow fast, and a product that is either fundamentally new or 10x better than existing options.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important way to help founders is to get them to be more ambitious‚Äîto think bigger and to have more self-belief.  Help them set ambitious but achievable goals. Momentum is important and self-reinforcing‚Äîmost people set goals that they expect to be just out of reach, which is usually demotivating.  It‚Äôs better to continuously set goals that you can just barely hit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The central learning of my career so far has been that you can and should scale up things that are working.  The power of scale, and the emergent behavior that sometimes comes from it, is tremendous. I think about the potential energy of future scale for every investment I make.  Most people seem terrible at this, so it‚Äôs another bug you can exploit.</p>

              The Fixation on Events
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In the Fifth Discipline, Peter Senge writes about the seven ‚Äúlearning disabilities‚Äù in organizations. These are the anti-patterns of team learning.</p>

<p>Among them, the one I find the most interesting, is the <em>fixation on events</em>. This is the behaviour created by reacting to short term events. Senge writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generative learning cannot be sustained in an organization if people‚Äôs thinking is dominated by short-term events. If we focus on events, the best we can ever do is predict an event before it happens so that we can react optimally. But we cannot learn to create.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter Kang expands on this in his <a href="https://www.peterkang.com/the-seven-learning-disabilities-from-the-fifth-discipline/">blog post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWe lost on too many deals this quarter so that is why we are not doing well financially right now‚Äù is a linear thought I‚Äôve had one too many times over the years. Of course, this fixation on short-term events is a real handicap and often leads to reactive behavior, like trying desperately to take on whatever new business we can to keep the business going.</p>

  <p>Thinking about our various activities on a longer time horizon and shifting away from a linear view of why things are the way they are can open up a lot of new possibilities. This is a big part of what Senge writes about later on in the book with systems thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I generally agree with this. What I‚Äôve seen happen is using a singular event as an example of causal behaviour. From the world of data science - ‚Äúthe plural of anecodote is not data‚Äù.</p>

<p>However I think there is value in learning how to string together events. Ignoring events can lead to another learning disability - the parable of the boiled frog - where each individual event is dismissed and can lead to disaster.</p>

<p>Another nuance to this is that fixation on events can be good if there‚Äôs a broader sense of self awareness. A ‚Äòself aware‚Äô individual and team will be able to strengthen it‚Äôs reaction to events, by noticing its own reaction and learning how to better keep itself prepared in the future.</p>

              <p>Li Jin recently published <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/08/key-metrics-for-the-passion-economy/">16 Key Metrics for the Passion Economy</a>, in which she outlined the various measures of success of startups in the space.</p>

<p>The first group focuses on the primary success metrics of the creators themselves - how well they are moving through the funnel. These include per creator metrics (% free supporters to becoming paid), to aggregrate views of their ecosystem (% creators have reached a certain threshold).</p>

<p>Each creator is a business, so they have to look at the growth of their business (typically through engagement metrics) and the revenue that audience is driving. There are also a number of interesting metrics to measure organic growth and network effects.</p>

<p>Now that every creator is being given the tools that many startups didn‚Äôt even have a decade ago, we can probably expect an massive increase in demand for skills that help software-powered businesses grow.</p>

              The Power of Compounding
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p><a href="https://howardlindzon.com/the-art-of-not-selling/">Howard Lindzon</a> posted this recently - a post by Akre Capital about the power of compound interest. The <a href="https://www.akrecapital.com/the-art-of-not-selling/">entire article</a> is terrific but this riddle really brings home the point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given the choice between two sums of money: one million dollars or a penny that will double every day for 30 days. Which should you choose?</p>

  <p>Here are a couple hints. The penny that doubles daily would be worth $1.28 after the first week. After the second week, it would be worth $163.84.</p>

  <p>You will probably reason that the penny would be worth more than the one million dollars. (Why, otherwise, all the theatrics?) By just how much, though, might surprise you.</p>

  <p>It turns out that after doubling 30 times, the penny would be worth $10,737,418.24!</p>

  <p>This is a terrific exercise because it highlights the not-so-obvious power of compound returns (in this case, the penny compounds at 100% for 30 periods).</p>

  <p>I say not-so-obvious because you would have been better off taking the one million dollars until the 27th day. But in those final four days, the value of the penny increases from less than $700,000 to more than $10.7 million. Patience and a long-term perspective are required to give the power of compounding an opportunity to do its magic.</p>

  <p>Most do not naturally grasp the concept of compound interest. It has been called the eighth wonder of the world (first by Albert Einstein, supposedly) for good reason. Most of us have to learn to appreciate it. And even once learned, we have to remind ourselves periodically of its wonder.</p>

  <p>From this riddle, we learn the importance of holding on so that we allow our investments to compound uninterrupted for long enough that the compounding effects we saw in days 27 to 30 have an opportunity to play out in our portfolios.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few key lessons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The benefits of compounding are often not visible until later. Patience counts. You are wrong for a long time, but then suddenly, you can become unequivocally right.</li>
  <li>The small continual changes will far outweigh the sudden big ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>A great reminder.</p>

              <p>An ultra short post today. It‚Äôs prediction season again and this one is extra special with all the decade stuff. Some of my favorites are Fred Wilson‚Äôs <a href="https://avc.com/2020/01/what-will-happen-in-the-2020s/">What Will Happen in the 2020‚Äôs</a>, Albert Wenger‚Äôs <a href="https://continuations.com/post/189997132065/an-agenda-for-the-2020s-inventing-the-knowledge">Agenda for the 2020‚Äôs</a> and A16Z‚Äôs <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/12/30/life-in-2030/">Life in 2030</a>.</p>

<p>My prediction: By 2030 we would be fighting our way back to the status quo (or even the past) on some things (like the climate crisis and the after effects of global nationalism). We will also see software become such an integral part of our lives that it will almost start to disappear from view altogether, <a href="/20190105/software-and-plastic.html">just like plastic</a>.

              <p>Another short post today as we go through this transition.</p>

<p>Moving isn‚Äôt unfamiliar. I‚Äôve travelled my <a href="/20180831/growing-up-everywhere.html">entire life</a> - but ofcourse at that stage I didn‚Äôt have any agency to decide where to.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs most surprising is that moving is a muscle that never goes away. Despite having been in one place for more than 20 years, the idea of disrupting everything doesn‚Äôt feel <em>difficult</em>. It‚Äôs reminded me of this innate ability to call anywhere home. Perhaps this is just the adrenaline of the entire experience but I haven‚Äôt felt overwhelmed (not quite yet, atleast). It feels like a muscle that, althought atrophied a bit, hasn‚Äôt quite disappeared.</p>

              <p>A friend recently asked, ‚Äòwhat do you think will be true for yourself in ten years‚Äô? It was an interesting approach to asking a common question. Two things came to mind. First, I simply hoped for physical and mental wellbeing for my family and myself. The second: I hope that I‚Äôll have a livelihood that is focused on <em>education</em>.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to try and predict the future. Intention seldom survives years, let alone a decade. That said, there probbaly isn‚Äôt a more important problem (outside of the climate crisis) that I can contribute towards. Whether its the growing skills gap, or the looming debt crisis fueled by student debt - the educational infrastructure around the globe is breaking at its seams. Information asymmetry is still rampant. Students, teachers and educational institutions are actively seeking better software solutions to improve the learning process. We‚Äôre also moving to a stage where software is solving higher order problems.</p>

<p>And I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring this innovation space further.</p>

              Thank You, Wattpad
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I thought it would be appropriate to write about the place where I spent the better part of the last decade.</p>

<p>Wattpad is an incredible <a href="/20190409/systems-of-impact.html">system of impact</a>. I‚Äôve learned so much about the meaning of leadership and company building through my time there. Many of these lessons were learned the hard way, but I‚Äôm grateful Allen and Ivan created a company where we had space to do those things.</p>

<p>There are so many individuals to thank; those that know me know I prefer to say those in person. For everyone in the leadership team I worked so closely with, to the early product, design and growth teams, and most recently to Emily and the entire Tap team: thank you so, so much for the lessons you taught me. Here are some of the most important ones I‚Äôm carrying with me.</p>

<p>I learned that first and foremost, it‚Äôs about the people. Understand every individuals intrinsic motivations, and try to align them to what the company and their team is trying to do. When those two forces align, magic happens. Understand that every individual is on their own journey of personal growth, and that you have the the privelege of sharing a chapter of their career with them. Use that wisely to help them develop in all the ways they want to.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve learned that individuals working together cohesively can create an unstoppable force. Individual flow is amazing, but team flow is almost magical. Understand that the relationships within an organization carry tremendous leverage; teach others to invest in them in order to get work done. Also, avoid zero sum team thinking. Reinforce the value of winning together; one team‚Äôs victory shouldn‚Äôt come at the expense of others, especially in small organizations.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve learned about the value of craft. That craft isn‚Äôt relegated for just design or product; sales or community management or is just as much of a craft. How we become better craftspeople is by practicing good habits. The consistency that we practice these habits will defines how successful we will be.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve learned so much about the dynamics of markets. More than anything, the value of a multi-year laser focus on a specific customer is a powerful way of creating massive market change. I‚Äôve learned how much winning matters, but every victory carries a timeline. The world changes around us rapidly; we can‚Äôt ignore those changes so even the best strategy can only be successful for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>One of the most valuable lessons has been that we have a higher responsibility as an organization, and especially as a software company with massive reach. We are accountable and responsible not just for our product, but for how it is used for good and bad. Wattpad has carried this ethos from early days when others were praying at the altar of growth at all costs. Understand that there are 2nd and 3rd order effects that we may not be able to predict but we still have to accept responsibility for. We also take responsibilty for our organization as a force of positive change, and know it has to be reflective of the diverse community we serve, and diverse group of individuals that choose to work here.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs to a new decade and new adventures.</p>

I‚Äôm filled with overwhelming gratitude - for the incredible relationships, for the challenges we‚Äôve overcome together, and the space to grow into who I am today.</p>

<p>In a few days, I‚Äôll be moving to New York City and starting a role at Endeavor, the entertainment and sports powerhouse, as SVP &amp; GM of Endeavor Education. I can‚Äôt wait to share more.</p>

              On Hard Work and Company Systems
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Yesterday Tobi <a href="https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1210242184341000192">posted</a> a tweetstorm that generated a lot of attention in the tech press. It addressed the ‚Äúhow hard should we work‚Äù debate, which is just another example of smart people collectively debating nonsense. Everyone is different and every situation is different. It makes no sense to attempt even a singular approach. I love hearing stories of people who hustled hard and achieved something they thought wasn‚Äôt possible. I also love stories that highlight the power of consistent, balanced effort over time.</p>

<p>But the Shopify story was the more interesting part of the thread. I took a few things away from it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The skill of the company is the sum of the individuals skills and context. ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù is purely a collective term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rings very true. The job of leaders is to draw the line between an individual and the impact they are trying to see in this world. We often call that line a ‚Äòcompany‚Äô but that word itself is an abstraction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs my belief that companies can only become better by the individuals in the company getting better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best companies behave as environments of continual growth and evolution. I like the analogy of a company as a learning community that generates knowledge and profits. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to work in places that have given me an environment to grow. It‚Äôs this commitment to individual growth that seperates the good from the great.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its all about people. Treating everyone with dignity and not falling into the fallacies and trappings of some orthodoxy. Don‚Äôt do things the way people with agenda tell you to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is especially true these days. Mental models, frameworks and ideologies are useful simplifications but there‚Äôs no way around the hard work of listening, understanding your unique needs, and building towards those. It also supports the company system model that I‚Äôve been using the last few years.</p>

              What Unites Republicans and Democrats is Changing
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Most of my blog posts recently have been reposts of recent articles. Part of it is because I‚Äôve lost some regularity of the habit because of some recent circumstances.</p>

<p>Today is no exception and there‚Äôs another article that was sent to me recently I found pretty fascinating - FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs recent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-unites-republicans-may-be-changing-same-with-democrats/">analysis of the changing dynamics of the Republican and Democratic parties</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Democrats have been considered the party of Asian, black, gay, Jewish and Latino people, along with atheists, teachers, union members, etc. ‚Äî in short, a coalition organized around a bunch of different identity groups. Meanwhile, Republicans have been thought of as the party of small government, low taxes, a strong national defense and ‚Äútraditional‚Äù moral values ‚Äî in short, a coalition based around a few core ideological principles.</p>

  <p>That has always been a fairly simplistic view of the parties. (And Grossmann and Hopkins‚Äôs book is much more nuanced.) But as an easy rubric to understand the two parties it worked. It still does, to some extent. But less and less so.</p>

  <p>The two big stories happening right now in American politics ‚Äî the 2020 Democratic primary and impeachment ‚Äî show both parties being reshaped in ways that break with that asymmetry: The GOP is becoming increasingly organized around identity groups, and Democrats are becoming increasingly ideological.</p>

              What Can a Technologist Do About Climate Change?
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A very short post today. I discovered an interesting visual and interactive essay today about how technologists should be thinking about climate change. Everyone in the startup community generally believes its the biggest issue of our time, but doesn‚Äôt quite know how to place themselves to help.

              From Pensions to Sidehustles
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>We‚Äôre in Orlando for the next week staying in a house attached to a golf course. It‚Äôs quintessential Florida. It‚Äôs also the result of my in-laws decades of hard work and pension plan. In a recent episode of The Patriot Act, Hasan Minhaj talked about the disappearing pension. Companies these days have elected to provide 401(k) and RRSP plans in lieu of a guaranteed pension. This provides a massive tax benefit to them and reduces their financial liability.</p>

<p>Further to that, the gig economy is giving more people the ability to supplement their income, and in some cases become the primary source altogether. But the gig economy can be very unstable. Platform rules can change overnight and what was sustained income can quickly disappear, as happened with Youtube‚Äôs demonization efforts.</p>

<p>So on one side of the barbell you have pensions that create a strong sense of financial security and community. On the other hand, the gig economy has given people side hustles that can meaningfully improve their individual standard of living (atleast in the short term), but don‚Äôt provide any long term predictable benefit. While the latter re-inforces the sense of individualism and independence, it‚Äôs in the times of crisis that it will really be tested.</p>

<p>America‚Äôs milennials are headed for an uncertain financial future and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have an easy or obvious solution at this point.</p>

              User Generated Financial Products
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>At the end of the year I often re-evaluate my financial setup. I go through all my financial products - the bank accounts, loans, insurance, mortgages, and more.</p>

<p>All these products are provided by financial service providers, of which there are a handful in Canada (even with all the fintech‚Äôs combined, there are only a few real providers). It reminds me of the traditional media industry in a way, where all the mainstream media products (books, movies, tv shows) are controlled by a small group (publishers, labels, movie studios, etc). The rise of user generated content communities has changed this, and now anyone to be a creator without any gatekeepers.</p>

<p>I wonder if that concept can make its way to finance. In that, what if anyone could design a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô. It could be as simple as an asset allocation mix that allows someone to invest into it, or as complex as a loan optimized for a specific life situation that maybe isn‚Äôt covered by what banks provide.</p>

<p>The simplest way this could start without a web of underwriting is to create an individual profile of all financial products used (bank accounts, investment allocations, loans etc), and allow others to copy that profile to suit their needs. Someone could gain social capital based on how many people have ‚Äòcloned‚Äô their financial profile for themselves. This dynamic could also uncover new types of products people want - either through a unique profile being cloned, or through the data from the network connections themselves.</p>

<p>Fintech products need to go from products that are ‚Äòinternet enabled‚Äô to ‚Äòinternet native‚Äô, in that they could not be created before the internet existed. I think this is just one way, but there‚Äôs plenty of innovation space to cover yet.</p>

              Smart Home Standards
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Recently Apple, Google, Amazon and Zigbee announced they were entering into an alliance to develop a new connected home standard over IP. The standard is called <a href="https://www.connectedhomeip.com/">Project Connected Home over IP</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal of the Connected Home over IP project is to simplify development for manufacturers and increase compatibility for consumers. The project is built around a shared belief that smart home devices should be secure, reliable, and seamless to use. By building upon Internet Protocol (IP), the project aims to enable communication across smart home devices, mobile apps, and cloud services and to define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21028256/smart-home-standard-google-apple-amazon-alexa-siri-zigbee-choip">The Verge has details</a> on this new standard, and some of the takeaways are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs amazing that the biggest players in the game have even agreed to get together at this level to solve the problem.</li>
  <li>The problem itself is one for developers, not consumers. Many customers don‚Äôt see the fragmentation issues because smart home assistants have made the setup smoother.</li>
  <li>The Zigbee Alliance is managing this working group and can act as a neutral arbiter between these companies.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it‚Äôs a positive step. Setting up a smart home is full of frustration - and anything that can make that process smoother for consumers and developers alike is a good development.</p>

              When to Sell
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I just had a really interesting conversation recently with an investment advisor about a certain part of my growth portfolio. Like many others in these market conditions, many investments have overperformed benchmarks and expectations. But the toughest part of the investment process is knowing <em>when to sell</em>.</p>

<p>I realized I don‚Äôt have a deterministic hypothesis or target, so the answer isn‚Äôt clear for me. It reminded me of two blog posts by Fred Wilson: <a href="https://avc.com/2018/08/selling-2/">Selling</a> and <a href="https://avc.com/2018/01/taking-money-off-the-table/">Taking Money Off the Table</a>.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite captions from the posts are below. Although most of them are in the venture capital context where sell decisions are not always in your control, some lessons are useful in public market investing as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you make an investment that is really working out, I have found that it is generally a good idea to hold on to it even when it goes past your original sell targets for it. It can be a useful discipline to develop new sell targets when this happens based on the new information you have about this investment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But even with all of these lessons I have learned and approaches I have developed over the years, I continue to struggle with selling. It is hard for me to do and I resist the urge, particularly with the big winners. It is like taking your medicine. You know it is the right thing to do but it doesn‚Äôt feel very good when you do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the opportunities to sell in venture:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the hardest things in managing a venture capital portfolio is managing your big winners. A big winner can dwarf the rest of the entire portfolio and you end up sitting on enormous paper profits that you can‚Äôt get liquid on. I realize that this seems like a great problem to have, and it is, but it is still a challenging situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taking money off the table is smart portfolio management. It is very different from selling your entire position, which could be brilliant but is equally likely to be a mistake. Selling a portion of your position, returning a multiple or two (or eight) of the fund, and holding on to the balance works out for you no matter which way the position goes in the future. If the position blows up, you got a lot out and booked a huge gain. If the position goes up significantly, you make even more money on the part of the investment you retained. If it goes sideway, you got a little bit out early. It is a win/win/win pretty much every way you look at it.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>It‚Äôs become clear to me that despite a decent streak of almost 500 posts, my writing habit hasn‚Äôt been able to survive a few weeks of very different daily routines. The change has been triggered by travel, some life events and the holiday season.</p>

<p>But, I still consider writing and this blog to be a central part of my thought process. I‚Äôve missed it and think about it often.</p>

<p>The key here is what James Clear called ‚Äúanchoring‚Äù in his book atomic habits. Writing was previously anchored in the beginning of my workday. I had cleared my schedule in the morning to make space for it. But, a different schedule meant I no longer have that space.</p>

<p>The solution is to anchor writing to something that happens daily no matter what. Perhaps it‚Äôs the first thing I do when I wake up, or right before going to bed. Let‚Äôs see - it‚Äôs time to strengthen this habit even more.</p>

              <p>The older I get the more I‚Äôve realized that living below your means, once you‚Äôve achieved a certain level of economic stability, is the ultimate form of freedom.</p>

<p>Living below your means is akin to a startup burning less cash than it brings in, and opens up the magic doors of <em>optionality</em>. It creates an environment in which risk/reward of a specific initiative can be without the pressure of failure. In effect, it gives you a financially supported pyschological safety.</p>

<p>This is where leverage becomes a great judge. Just as much as I pay attention to the money in (investment returns, income, etc), I look at ways of increasing leverage for all the money out. This quickly filters out the material trappings as a good use of money.</p>

<p>In a time of year when consumer culture is on full display, I find a lot of happiness in not trying keep up with any Joneses.</p>

              <p>Paul Graham recently wrote a very personal piece about <a href="http://paulgraham.com/kids.html">having kids</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶One of the great things about having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you‚Äôd rather be, and nothing else you‚Äôd rather be doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me kids forced a self reflection into my own identity. Probably triggered when I realized these two people are now looking upto me as an example of how to live. Kids also awoke this innate curiousity about the world. When someone sees a plant, a shape, or a color for the first time, it makes you think about how they will perceive and remember that thing.</p>

<p>Kids create some inexpressible feelings that I‚Äôm still navigating. One day I hope to fully put them into words.</p>

              <p>I‚Äôve been travelling this week. I‚Äôve had some incredible conversations over the last few days and my mind is buzzing. But, my writing is suffering. I‚Äôve missed a few days and have to catch up.</p>

<p>there are so many factors that a surrounding environment can do to help build a habit. When that disappears suddenly, the habit becomes more difficult. So Writing itself isn‚Äôt difficult, but with a packed travel schedule it‚Äôs a challenge.</p>

<p>The thing with routine is you start to take it for granted. In new environments muscles need to get rebuilt, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed now.</p>

              <p>I‚Äôve had the good fortune to be able to chat with Nikhyl a few times, and have always left those conversations with pages full of insight. He recently sat down with First Round and published a piece about <a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-to-craft-your-product-team-at-every-stage-from-pre-product-market-fit-to-hypergrowth/">how to craft product teams in different phases of company growth</a>. It‚Äôs an excellent and thorough article and I‚Äôll be using it as a reference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That‚Äôs why Singhal always finds himself dishing out the same piece of advice: <strong>You need to craft a product team to match the phase of your company.</strong> In other words, from the early struggles of finding product/market fit and hiring your first PM, to the ‚Äúteenage years‚Äù of optimizing products in the messy middle and growing to a 10-person product org, to the blistering pace of hypergrowth, every phase of a startup‚Äôs life brings a unique set of challenges for the product org.</p>

              What Really Matters
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Nothing matters more than the relationships.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve worked with me you‚Äôve probably heard me emphasize this point. This is especially true for startups where risk of failure is higher than other companies. But it‚Äôs a universal rule no matter the size of the company. Good relationships with your coworkers makes all the difference in tough situations. And ultimately, when the intersections in our career journeys ends, it‚Äôs the relationships that are left.</p>

<p>But it applies elsewhere too. Good relationships with partners makes it easier to resolve unforeseen circumstances. And the same for customers - when you launch something and it doesn‚Äôt go as planned, maintaining trust with your community can save the day.</p>

              <p>One truth that has become apparent in the last few months is the amount of knowledge asymmetry that exists in so many parts of our lives, from finance to career choices. Some of that asymmetry comes with privelege - those who know are protective of their secretive ways. There is some room to play in the margin but it is not a sustainable advantage. It‚Äôs a knowledge arbitrage so to speak.</p>

<p>But the walls are being broken down and any institution or practice that survives entirely on the basis of this is doomed to fail. I think this is an entirely good thing. When more people ask right questions to ask in a negotiation or take advantage of the best investment strategies, the scarce becomes abundant, and we can raise the tide for everyone.</p>

<p>Understanding the evolution of individuals, teams, products, markets, and impacts have evolved can give a very comprehensive understanding of a company.

<p>Some questions that can help reveal the company stories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How have you evolved inside the organization?</li>
  <li>For managers: What were some of the inflection points that led to your growth as a leader?</li>
  <li>What did this product look like before? What were some of the biggest features / capabilities added over the last few years?</li>
  <li>How did our understanding of the market evolve over time?</li>

              Lessons from AWS
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>AWS Re:invent is back - with everything from a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer/?hp=r">machine-learning powered keyboard</a> or a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/braket/?hp=r">development environment for experimenting with quantum computing</a>. It‚Äôs amazing to see the breadth and depth of new services launched with AWS.</p>

<p>In a past life, I was an mobile developer intern working on Amazon‚Äôs mobile products. This was 2001. The team was responsible for making Amazon available anywhere except the PC, hence the name Amazon Anywhere. Those were <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-anywhere-not-quite-everywhere/">tumultuous times</a> for tech, but what came out of that team was the foundation of Amazon web services. By giving mobile developers the ability to access Amazon data, they created the foundations of the first API based services. One of the questions asked was - well, if this API is valuable to us, what if it was opened up to others too? They could probably find it valuable too. And AWS was born.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to be the first intern on the AWS team, and helped to develop the first developer portal for AWS. I remember conversations talking about other parts of the Amazon software stack - everything from email to payments to search. We would discuss how third party developers could find them useful and what innovative services they would create. Since then Amazon took that thinking and went through the entire software and hardware stack - storage, compute, and so much more - and abstracted it for others to utilize.</p>

<p>AWS is now an incredible business - the highest margin of Amazon‚Äôs profit lines. There are many business lessons from AWS, but one of the most powerful I‚Äôve always found is to recognize existing units of value in a business, and determine how to find a broader market for that value.</p>

<p>Again, there was a clear winner here - word of mouth. This drove initial demand for Airbnb, Lyft, Opentable and many others.

              <p>A short meta-post for today. As we close the chapter on the year and decade, I‚Äôve been thinking about how to commemorate this on the blog. This last 2 years has been very unlike the 8 before it, in large part to this collection of random writing. This small corner of the internet has helped me clarify my thinking in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll definitely use it to reflect on the most meaningful events from the last 10 or so years. I also want to go through an exercise to evaluate the current state of my life. And of course, use it to clarify my approach towards an increasingly uncertain future.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This week has been another reminder that the older I get, the more I run towards risk. This means looking for areas of highest risk, and focusing all attention on making them lower risk.</p>

<p>Finding the highest areas of risk is instinctive, but when it‚Äôs competing against other priorities I often do an exercise of mapping out atleast the first and second order outcomes of any decision. The most negative outcomes automatically become the highest risk areas to focus on.</p>

<p>De-risking often means just making a key decision and then owning the outcome. Nothing is without any risk and the future is uncertain, but there‚Äôs comfort in fully understanding the scope of what‚Äôs known, and being okay with the rest.</p>

<p>The opposite of this approach is avoidance - looking at the higher risk areas and creating a story in your mind that they will go away for some reason. The few times you get lucky and they <em>do</em> go away, only serves to reinforce this mindset. But it‚Äôs dangerous and only creates more anxiety.</p>

              A Cycle of Epiphanies

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I sometimes get stuck in analysis paralysis. Not a consequential realization, but <em>how</em> it happens is definitely interesting. For me, that uncertainty looks like a cycle of epiphanies.</p>

<p>This means that I am regularly having grand moments of realization - about myself or the world around me. These moments themselves are extremely satisfying because it creates a feeling of accomplishment. They make me feel like I‚Äôve found the missing piece in the puzzle that helps me make sense of a certain situation. But as soon as they pass, I realize there is another missing piece. That feeling of accomplishment fades quickly, and the analysis-paralysis continues until the next epiphany.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs now happened enough that I can detect and snap out of it. This usually involves making real forward progress on whatever it is that I‚Äôm worried about - making a decision or trying something new. Or really anything else that creates real world learning.</p>

<p>Not to say that I don‚Äôt enjoy those moments of epiphany. But just like anything else, it‚Äôs easy to have too much of a good thing. <a href="https://twitter.com/KapilGuptaMD/status/1200216119195385857">This tweet</a> captures the sentiment well:</p>

  <p>Epiphanies are not valued for the thing being realized. But for the excitement for having realized them. Both are short-lived.</p>

<p>At the same time, I try to mindful of when I‚Äôm using busy as an excuse.</p>

<p>The habits that are central to our identity - the things we do that make us feel whole - compel their way into the calendar. Sometimes it‚Äôs because we adjust our schedule to <em>make</em> time, other times it‚Äôs the guilt from missing a few days that creates the force.</p>

A lot has been talked about regarding direct listings, especially recently with tech IPO‚Äôs not turning out as planned. Direct listings allow companies to create a secondary market of existing shares (held by employees, advisors, insiders) available directly to the public. This allows companies to avoid the archaic process of going to banks, but more importantly lets the market decide the price via auction (vs. bankers). Letting the market decide also makes a lot of sense especially for companies that are more well known to individual investors.</p>

<p>The overwhelming answer here is <em>direct sales</em>. Nothing beats going door to door, building a pipeline and running a process to execute it. A classic strategy that works across industries, and way more effective than any other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most significant learnings (and surprises) for me in doing this research was how important one-on-one direct sales was to most early marketplaces. Sales ended up being a crucial lever for about 60% of the companies I talked to ‚Äî twice as common as the next biggest lever (piggy-backing and referrals).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other mechanisms are all common marketing levers - referrals, piggybacking on another network (often craigslist), word of mouth (strong dynamics in supply side, eg. restauraunts), subsidizing, paid growth, using employees as early supply, building single player mode, flywheels, SEO, events, and community based marketing.</p>

If you‚Äôre working, you‚Äôre probably heading into a seasonably busy or very slow few weeks. Either way, it feels entirely <em>different</em> than the months before.</p>

<p>For many software companies, it‚Äôs the final push. The last few sprints before a code freeze. The last launch before we call it a year. Thinking and planning for 2020.</p>

<p>The best part of this year is that it forces focus. When you only have a few weeks left in a year, priorities become evident and things are quickly shelved for later. I love this mode of quick decision making, of quiet efficiency. This is how things should <em>always</em> be.</p>

<p>The key highlight is that 80% of the marketplaces he examined grew on the back of supply side growth. Whether it was Lyft, Eventbrite or Opentable, all of them focused on growing the catalog available to them.</p>

<p>There were a few exceptions. Rover and Taskrabbit didn‚Äôt have supply issues - primarily because supply was independent entreprenuers doing this stuff on the side. Basically anyone could walk a dog or do a taskrabbit - you don‚Äôt need to be licensed. Another one was Zillow - where supply was just public data - not actual listings - which they used to bootstrap demand which then allowed them to get real data. It was an interesting ‚Äòbait and switch approach‚Äô.</p>

<p>Another highlight is Patreon, which thought of itself as a marketplace first but now has clarified that it isn‚Äôt one at all, and only serves creators in the same way Shopify serves entrepreneurs. It‚Äôs a shift in thinking that‚Äôs creating an entirely new category of software - one that A16Z dubs the ‚Äò<a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/">passion economy</a>‚Äô.</p>

              Forces at Play and Base Rates
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>We all find ourselves in situations sometimes where there‚Äôs a high degree of uncertainty in our decisions. It often comes when starting something new or entering a new domain.</p>

<p>Two exercises that reduce this uncertainty are understanding the <strong>forces at play</strong> and determining <strong>base rates</strong>. Understanding forces at play is about becoming familiar with the system in which you are operating, so that you may use it to your advantage. Determining a base rate is about looking at history to examine what success (and failure) has looked like in the past, so as to establish a benchmark for your own actions.</p>

<p>The term ‚Äòforces at play‚Äô comes from Charlie Munger‚Äôs <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/04/munger-two-step/">two step decision making process</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A simple and easy approach to decision making that prevents us from being manipulated:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Understand the forces at play.</li>
    <li>Understand how your subconscious might be leading you astray.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>On that first step:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key to the first step is knowing what you know and what you don‚Äôt know. You need to understand your circle of competence. It‚Äôs just as important to know what you don‚Äôt know as it is to know what you know.</p>

  <p>If you know what you don‚Äôt know, you might still have to make a decision, but your approaches for making that decision will change. For example, if you‚Äôre forced to make a decision in an area that you know is well outside your circle of competence, one tool you can use is inversion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forcing ourselves to understand the world around us, especially the ‚Äòunknowns‚Äô, will help us harness those forces towards whatever objective we are trying to reach. That second step - to understand our own biases - is another important step especially before making any decision.</p>

<p>The term ‚Äòbase rates‚Äô comes from statistics. It represents the percentage of a population that exhibit a certain characteristic. It‚Äôs most basic use is determining the probability that a member of that population will also have that characteristic. For example, if 40% of immigrants in Canada are from India, then if you choose one immigrant in Canada, they have a 40% chance of being from India.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the great lessons from studying history is to do with ‚Äúbase rates‚Äù. ‚ÄúBase rate‚Äù is a technical term of describing odds in terms of prior probabilities. The base rate of having a drunken-driving accident is higher than those of having accidents in a sober state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understanding the base rates in a new environment helps to determine whether a certain decision you‚Äôre considering has worked before or not, or atleast give you a sense of whether it will work.</p>

<p>Both these techniques paired together can provide a broader context to how a new unfamiliar system works. One gives a general view of how the system behaves, and another gives insight into how a decision might fare in this system. They are useful on their own, but very powerful when paired together.</p>

              The Education Transformation (via USV)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been lucky to work with the amazing team at Union Square Ventures here at Wattpad. Today they wrote a <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2019/11/the-education-transformation/">post</a> about the state of the education market, and the transformation taking place in the industry.</p>

<p>The crux of the problem is that education represents the highest growing cost for an average American. It‚Äôs become increasingly difficult financially to afford a decent education - ironically at the same time education delivery technology has improved rapidly.</p>

<p>From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our education portfolio has become a core value driver in our funds. In part, we think this is because we have hit the tipping point in consumers‚Äô interest in self-driven, direct-to-learner education because technology has enabled higher quality education to be delivered at a lower price point, a counter-balance to the inflationary trends we‚Äôve seen to date. Appetite for products and services that reframe what it means to learn ‚Äì and how to learn ‚Äì is high, and quickly accelerating. Which is all to say, we‚Äôre ready for more and eager to meet the teams that are building the products and platforms that will restructure education.</p>

              WYDIWYA: On Genghis Khan
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôm slow reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are-ebook/dp/B07NVN4QCM">What You Do is Who You Are</a> by Ben Horowitz, and writing a series of posts to capture some key points from each major section. This post is about Genghis Khan‚Äôs rise to power and what it has to teach us about establishing culture.</p>

<p>Genghis used a decentralized management and speed as his secret weapon against clans much largers than his own army. He also ensured best practices of the places he was conquering were brought into the fold in his army - enabling a culture of continuous learning. There were three principles that helped him create a stable culture: meritocracy, loyalty, and inclusion.</p>

<p>Metitocracy was about destroying the hierarchical and sexist structures of the military in the past. He changed his military structure to operate as concentric circles vs. hierarchies with a consistent chain of command. This allowed him to get rid of those that were there just for status, and promote soliders to leaders if they demonstrated that ability.</p>

<p>Loyalty was a ‚Äúbilateral relationship‚Äù, almost synonymous with trust. It was about having the option to punish someone for not obeying orders, but also not always exercising that option. Genghis wanted to preserve Mongol life even as he was conquering the country, so this was applied universally not just within his army.</p>

<p>Inclusion was about getting rid of the aristocrats and helping soliders rise up from the bottoms up, thereby building trust and loyalty. This applied to the enemies he conquered too. He also created inclusion by creating new ethical boundaries - he outlawed crimes against women and children - something that was commonly accepted during those times.</p>

<p>His decentralized approach to creating culture was a revolutionary approach, and although it fell apart because of succession issues, the change he was able to create was remarkable.</p>

              WYDIWYA: On Senghor
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôm slow reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are-ebook/dp/B07NVN4QCM">What You Do is Who You Are</a> by Ben Horowitz, and writing a series of posts to capture some key points from each major section. This post is about the chapter on Shaka Senghor who spent 20 years incarcerated and led change within that culture of violence.</p>

<p>Senghor‚Äôs story is long and one of the most interesting chapters in the book. He rose ranks within the Melanics gang in his jail, then challenged it‚Äôs leaders on their adherence to their principles. This helped him build the trust of new recruits and eventually the leaders themselves. He used his platform to enact changes in the principles themselves.</p>

<p>Some of the key lessons from Sengor apply in the context of someone coming in to change the culture of an organization. In order to do this, one needs to understand some important truths. Here are a few:</p>

<p>Culture changes people so it‚Äôs hard to measure by asking everyone - but the best indicator is those new to the organization. In those first few weeks and months, employees figure out what they need to do to fit in, survive and succeed. If you want to understand your company culture, ask those folks right after those first weeks.</p>

<p>One must live the code. This is an ideal Ben brings up in other chapters too. But in a jail environment, living the code can mean the difference between life or death; stability or chaos. One must put in cultural elements that you actually subscribe to yourself.</p>

<p>Culture is universal. It applies not only to how you treat employees, but also partners, vendors and everyone that your employees come into contact. Your culture travels with them and you need to be prepared to address issues in all those interactions.</p>

<p>Culture will also get weaponized. People will interpret your code one way, and in an incentive to impress might choose to go to an extreme. It‚Äôs difficult to predict all the ways this can happen, but important to react quickly when it does. Often that means a clarification or counterbalancing rule. In Slack‚Äôs case, their ‚Äúempathy‚Äù rule was being weaponized to dull negative feedback. So, they changed it to ‚Äúcollaborative‚Äù, making it clear that the team outcome is more important than any individuals.</p>

<p>Culture might require you to change yourself. This is intentional, after all. You are trying to change behaviours of an entire group - this should also apply to you as an individual. Ben provides an example of how he himself ‚Äòweaponized‚Äô his value by equating the truth with simply what was legal. He changed himself and the value so that the emphasis was on the truth being <em>received</em>, vs. simply just the truth being told. It was a higher bar.</p>

<p>Culture requires constant contact. Just like many leadership activities, repetition is the name of the game. It not only creates cadence but reinforces priority.</p>

              WYDIWYA: On Bushido
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôm slow reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are-ebook/dp/B07NVN4QCM">What You Do is Who You Are</a> by Ben Horowitz, and writing a series of posts to capture some key points from each major section. This post is about how understanding the Bushido code can help build a stronger company culture.</p>

<p>The first lesson is the difference between values and virtues; the former being a set of beliefs vs the latter being behaviours, and how Bushido is structured:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bushido looks like a set of principles, but it‚Äôs a set of practices. The samurai defined culture as a code of action, as system not of values but of virtues. A value is merely a belief, but a virture is a belief that you actively prusue or embody.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So many corporate cultures center around ‚Äòvalues‚Äô which immediately makes them ineffective. As Ben states, ‚Äúwhat you believe means nearly nothing. What you <em>do</em> is who you are.‚Äù</p>

<p>The second lesson is on the importance of death. In the samurai context this meant living with the highest degree of honor and attention to your craft, because death can be around any corner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea is to take care of your public and private duties day and night, and then whenever you have free time when your mind is unoccupied, you think of death, bringing it to mind attentively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a company context keeping death in mind at all times also means thinking about the worst case scenario and planning for what happens next. How do you want your company to be talked about after? How do you want your employees to feel about their time there? Keeping these questions in mind will help you prioritize what‚Äôs really important.</p>

<p>Although there are eight samurai virtues, the ones discussed in detail in the book were honor, politeness, and veracity or sincerety. Honor is about how you apply your set of standards in an organization - whether it‚Äôs with business dealings, product quality, or employee issues. High honor companies are consistent and systematic in their approach. Politeness is about expressing love and respect for those around you. To ensure that politeness didn‚Äôt get used to be fake, there was strong emphasis on the truth - expressed in the virtue of sincerety.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did the bushido have such a profound impact on Japanese society? The complex answer is that the samurai developed and refined their culture continuously over a very long period of time, using a variety of psychologically sophisticated techniques to make it feel indelible, inescapable and completely natural.</p>

  <p>The simple answer is that they kept death in mind at all times.</p>

              Incentive Profiles for Leaders
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I had a really great conversation recently about how important it is to align leaders with similar incentive structures to foster the right behaviours. Compensation structures are the one of the highest leverage driver of behaviour in an org (especially at executive level), and it‚Äôs important for leaders to have common incentive profiles to ensure they are working in the collective interest vs. their own.</p>

<p>Some teams work very differently so it‚Äôs not uncommon to see different structures coexist - certain executives compensated for making decisions that pay off in the long term (i.e. with equity), and others compensated for hitting short term goals (e.g. with cash bonuses).</p>

<p>But if there are no <em>common</em> elements to those incentive profiles, it can create unhealthy mercenary behaviours.</p>

<p>I see this difference often in leaders of pipeline-centric vs product-centric orgs. Pipeline orgs are designed to push pipelines forward, get more and bigger deals done. There‚Äôs a very clear 1:1 relationship between effort and outcome. Product centric orgs can get squishier - many decisions don‚Äôt pay off in the short term. Infact sometimes the opposite can happen - a short term failure can lead to a long term success. In these cases it doesn‚Äôt make sense to compeonsate an employee with a short term incentive like cash.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen orgs do this well where all executives will have some component of their compensation that follows the same structure. Obviously stock option grants are a great way to make this happen. They are generally aligned towards long term goals and can make sure everyone acts in the long term best interests of the company.</p>

              How to Disagree

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A sign of healthy company culture is meetings where people openly can disagree with each other. It signals a net of psychological safety in which dissent and challenge is seen as productive, and in which failure is seen as a sign of learning. This is especially true in knowledge organizations where the role of leadership is to <em>amplify</em> the innovative ideas coming from the edges of the company.</p>

<p>However, getting here is difficult. The raw ingredients include trust and respect among peers, clear lines of decision making, and a collective intentionality to get better as a team.</p>

<p>Trust and respect is built one interaction at a time. It requires listening more than talking. It‚Äôs about developing an honest curiosity for someone elses opinion. Delivering feedback in the right way (timely and direct) also signals respect for others opinions and intentions.</p>

<p>Clear lines of decison making create structure for group interactions. When everyone knows the process of making a decision, who the owner is, and how much information is needed to make said decision, everything moves quicker. Without any of these things decisions start to linger. The point on intentionality is about paying attention to  <em>how</em> things are done, not just what is being done. Groups need to be mindful of their dynamic and understand how best to harness it together.</p>

<p>For leaders providing feedback in group settings, I‚Äôve found success in picking the right battles. Leaders have natural leverage that sometimes becomes overused on details that are often unimportant. Providing feedback on everything can quickly become noise and ignored (or worse yet, shut out altogether).</p>

              WYDIWYA: On Louverture and Leadership
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôm slow reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are-ebook/dp/B07NVN4QCM">What You Do is Who You Are</a> by Ben Horowitz, and writing a series of posts to capture some key points from each major section. The first is the story and lessons from Toussaint Louverture rise.</p>

<p>The chapters on Louverture center around some themes that helped him establish a culture so strong that it led to the only successful slave revolt in human history. Those themes include (with examples from the business world):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Keep what works: Understand what parts of your business make it work well. In transforming culture, don‚Äôt throw those out. For Apple, the dedication to vertical integration - owning software and hardware - was something Steve Jobs kept as part of his transformation of Apple in the 90‚Äôs and 2000‚Äôs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create shocking rules: Rules need to be memorable, straightforward, and answer the <em>why</em> - on a daily basis. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre on time, you‚Äôre late‚Äù speaks to the value of our own and others‚Äô time. ‚ÄúNo powerpoint in meetings‚Äù takes the crutches away and forces clarity of thought through written documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dress for success: By <em>dressing the part</em>, Louverture forced his soliders to think of themselves as disciplined soldiers, not just fighters. In the business world, Michael Ovitz (of CAA fame) set an example by wearing suits every day. That example set an expectation of professionalism that trickled down to the entire organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incorporate outside leadership: Understand the gaps in your organization, and then bring in the experts that can fill in those gaps. When a business is pivoting to a different customer type or go to market strategy, you need leadership that doesn‚Äôt have to learn on the job. Not that the latter cannot succeed, it‚Äôs just much harder to rewire DNA from within. Culture calcifies until someone external comes in to break the mold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make decisions that demonstrate priorities: The best example here is of Reed Hastings kicking DVD executives out of the Netflix leadership meeting during their shift to streaming. It was a bold decision that demonstrated that Netflix needed to become a streaming-first company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Walk the Talk: A simple principle - live your truth and lead by example. Ben himself acknowledges it‚Äôs not the only way to lead, but the lack of it quickly erodes trust within a team. The attitudes and actions of those at the top have a trickle down effect - for better and for worse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make Ethics Explicit: Ben highlights Uber‚Äôs hyper-competitive culture was what drove its success, but also it‚Äôs downfall amidst the sexual harrassment scandal. What Uber failed to do was establish an ethical foundation upon which it‚Äôs values were to be practiced. It led to people misapplying competitiveness to silence coworkers, squeeze profits from drivers, and so much more. Dara reversed course and introduced a new set of values - one that included a strong proclamation - <em>We do the right thing. Period.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

              Personal Finance and Subconscious Social Approval
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Yesterday I wrote a short commentary on how fintech is helping us becoming better savers by taking the savings decision away entirely. It also got me thinking about personal finance, and the role of an ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô social approval.</p>

<p>Last year, I was rebuilding my personal finance ‚Äústack‚Äù - the philosophies, methods, and tools I use to manage savings, budgeting and investments. To do this, I asked about 10-15 acquaintances some very pointed questions about how they manage their money.</p>

<p>All asks were in relative terms - percentages vs. dollars, but I asked specific questions about the asset allocations, contribution patterns, savings as a % of income, etc. The incentive to them providing such personal information was that they would get to see the data from others that I asked. I was surprised to see how open people were with the information.</p>

<p>When I spoke to my friend Anish Acharya about this experiment, he came up with the perfect analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are all ashamed to talk about our financial shortcomings but everyone experiences them, so we‚Äôre all ‚Äúalone together‚Äù. It‚Äôs like being in a dark room unknowingly surrounded by all your friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think social approval subconsciously drives our financial habits more than we think. Financial literacy is not taught consistently, and this is amplified in heterogeneous cultures like Canada. Knowing what others close to us are doing can provide a real sense of comfort.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advertising is based on one thing: happiness. And do you know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It‚Äôs freedom from fear. It‚Äôs a billboard on the side of a road that screams with reassurance that whatever you‚Äôre doing is OK. You are OK.</p>

              <p>Yesterday, I <a href="/20191106/the-world-has-gone-mad.html">wrote</a> about Ray Dalio‚Äôs piece <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-has-gone-mad-system-broken-ray-dalio/">The World has Gone Mad and The System is broken</a>, which pointed out that excess capital is causing fund managers to make horrible investment decisions. Coincidentally, yesterday Softbank released their <a href="https://cdn.group.softbank/en/corp/set/data/irinfo/presentations/results/pdf/2019/softbank_presentation_2019_002.pdf">earnings deck</a> and, well, it‚Äôs a doozy.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs filled with mentions of ‚Äúhypothetical EBITDA‚Äù and charts with no units on their vertical axes. When I first saw it, it was hilarious. It doesn‚Äôt seem real. But take away the humor and it‚Äôs pretty clear that all this excess capital is being distributed to mismanaged companies with questionable business fundamentals at best.</p>

<p>Tech culture likes to brand itself closely to utopian ideals, but when you follow the money it‚Äôs pretty clear that it‚Äôs just making existing problems worse. This is not good for Softbank, ofcourse, but it‚Äôs horrible for the brand image of the technology industry and those new to it.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Self Driving Money
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Anish Acharya, partner at A16Z, recently published <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/07/fintech-can-save-us-from-ourselves/">Fintech can save us from ourselves</a>, a piece about how technology can help us make better savings decisions. He offers a few patterns that have been more effective than shaming techniques. All of them take the decision away from users, and automatically make the best decision.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Invisible savings, used by Digits, which automatically saves your money and puts it in a separate savings account</li>
  <li>Prized-linked savings, in which consumers are entered to win a jackpot anytime they save a certain amount in their own accounts. This has natural network effects because the prize increases anytime a new customer joins the pool (although probability of winning decreases).</li>
</ul>

<p>As fintech starts to ‚Äúharness our biases‚Äù, as Anish says, I think there are two interesting factors to consider.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is a very personal choice. Whether it‚Äôs invisible or prize linked savings, or another technique - there‚Äôs an opportunity for a product to aggregate all the options in a simple to use product, and allow consumers to switch between different savings methods based on their life stage and circumstances.</li>
  <li>These products deliver reassurance to consumers that they are making the right choices with their money (in this case, by taking the choice away altogether). Another source of reassurance comes from the social cues - peers and others that one respects. If a friend is saving money in a certain way, knowing that you‚Äôre doing something similar to them can really help. This dynamic can be exploited to drive growth of an existing product (i.e. getting notified that your friend is saving X% more because of this app can be really effective). Further, if one were able to view ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù of other people‚Äôs saving formulas and apply them to their own accounts, that could harness that same dynamic. This ‚Äòuser generated‚Äô profile can be used to identify saving patterns that might be different across cultures too (where mental models of how to manage money are very different).</li>
</ul>

              <p>Ray Dalio wrote an interesting piece entitled <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-has-gone-mad-system-broken-ray-dalio/">The World has Gone Mad and The System is broken</a>. He highlights a few unsustainable conflating factors that can affect the global economy:</p>

<p>Investors at all levels are flush with cheap money (because of low interest), and are pouring it into investments that will yield no and sometimes known negative returns. This bad decision making is . This is happening across asset classes but pronounced in private equity and venture. One note here is that the excess capital 
Large governments have rising deficits, and while raising interest rates is the best way to keep them in check, governments would sooner print money to keep markets and economies in growth mode. 
Pension funds won‚Äôt be able to meet their investment targets and pensions will fall short. This will also happen to healthcare. This will result in cutting benefits, raising taxes or printing even more money to meet the obligations - all of which will widen the wealth gap.
The wealth gap will be exacerbated by poor losing creditworthiness, and the rich getting even richer because money is free. This brings into question the viability of trickle down economics - making it clear that this breed of capitalism doesn‚Äôt work for most people.</p>

<p>This is a really interesting set of changes taking place that will likely have massive impacts. I‚Äôll examine some of the second order effects in a later post.</p>

Also, that the massive spike in the price of Bitcoin in 2010 was driven by <strong>one</strong> investor, not many.</p>

<p>This was initially brought up in an <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066">academic paper</a> by two professors at Ohio State University.

<blockquote>
  <p>Griffin and Shams studied Bitcoin and Tether transactions from March 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018. They found that Bitcoin purchases on Bitfinex increased whenever the price dropped by certain increments. According to Bloomberg, which saw a prepublication version of a paper set to be published in the Journal of Finance, the authors conclude: ‚ÄúThis pattern is only present in periods following the printing of Tether, driven by a single large account holder, and not observed by other exchanges.‚Äù</p>

              Some Thoughts on Influencers, Software and Culture
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Venture attention has shifted to the supply side of many marketplaces as more people are becoming independent. There are many startups across industries helping creators become independently successful, a trend detailed in this recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/venture-capitalists-like-and-subscribe-to-influencers/">Techcrunch article</a>.</p>

<p>On the broader trend of serving influencers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶Entrepreneurs have also begun building services for creators and influencers from marketplaces that connect individuals with brands, financial solutions that help capitalize burgeoning influencer-led businesses, and tailored monetization platforms‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the 3rd phase of the influencer economy (I think the term influencer here is synonymous with ‚Äúindependent entrepreneur‚Äù):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first phase was the rise of the media platforms: YouTube, Instagram, etcetera, that allowed creatives to build audiences. The second phase was the emergence of influencer marketing, or connecting those influencers to brands to leverage their audiences ‚Ä¶ Now that influencer marketing has become an established part of the marketing playbook, we are in phase three: tools to help influencers further monetize their influence, like Cameo, and then manage their lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could be seen simply in a shift in focus in marketplaces. But I think it represents a broader shift from software being overly consumer focused (to a certain extent value destructive), to serving those actually creating the culture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PostgREST is a standalone web server that turns your PostgreSQL database directly into a RESTful API. The structural constraints and permissions in the database determine the API endpoints and operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The motivation for PostGREST feels very Rails-ish in spirit - focusing on convention over configuration and preventing room for programming errors.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using PostgREST is an alternative to manual CRUD programming. Custom API servers suffer problems. Writing business logic often duplicates, ignores or hobbles database structure. Object-relational mapping is a leaky abstraction leading to slow imperative code. The PostgREST philosophy establishes a single declarative source of truth: the data itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This works only for Postgres DB‚Äôs right now. I think we‚Äôll see a lot more of these trends that help app developers create data interoperability into their products.</p>

<p>This reminds me of apps like <a href="https://sheetsu.com/">Sheetsu</a>, which turns any Google spreadsheet into an API.</p>

              <p>Today the <a href="www.teachable.com">Teachable</a> team launched <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/discover-by-teachable">Discover</a>. I‚Äôve been a fan of this product for a while, and I think this move is a really interesting one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Teachable Discover is a curated collection of the 50+ best courses on the Teachable platform. Unlike other course websites, Discover gives complete ownership to to the creator on pricing, student ownership and full lifetime value after the first sale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it‚Äôs significant because it‚Äôs an example of what‚Äôs happening in marketplaces across the internet. The supply side (creators, writers, hosts, teachers etc) is losing trust in intermediaries, increasing demand for tools to help them own their destiny as entrepreneurs. This is precisely how Teachable started:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the time, we were Udemy course creators who wanted a way to sell courses on our own website. We wanted to control pricing, have ownership of our audience, sell higher priced product and much more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, they are building the distribution network that puts that supply side in control. This is a very natural evolution. While it may seem like they‚Äôre shifting attention to the other side of the marketplace, they‚Äôre doing so with a lot of thoughtfulness towards their original customer - the course creators. I would expect similar changes to happen in marketplaces across different industries.</p>

              <p>Howard Marks, famed investor and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B078977BRM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Market Cycle</a> once wrote that ‚Äúinvesting is more art than science.‚Äù</p>

<p>The art is in the ability to understand and manage your own judgement.</p>

<p>The science is the structure of that judgement, not in the decisions themselves. The discipline of investing is akin to the scientific method - questioning, forming a hypothesis, testing it, and observing and sharing results. That test comes in the form of an investment decision.</p>

<p>Just like any art form, it is an expression. And given it is so closely tied to human judgement, that expression can become a true reflection of one‚Äôs identity.</p>

<p>That unit of expression is not the decisions themselves - it‚Äôs one‚Äôs asset allocation. This is the ratio of all investments across different risk profiles. If you see yourself as being more risk-averse, you‚Äôll likely see that reflected in more conservative investments. Ofcourse, that will change over time. The act of continual rebalancing is a way of adjusting that expression to your current value system.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found the best investors have a keen sense of themselves, not just their investments. It‚Äôs perhaps why investment advice can often sound like life advice.</p>

              <p>I recently found out about Bisq - a decentralized exchange for trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Coinbase is great for many things, but recently changed it‚Äôs rules so new bank accounts can‚Äôt be linked to buy crypto. I was left looking for a new exchange and found Bisq. Bisq is a piece of software, protocol and network that allows for private exchange of crypto between users, focusing on security, privacy and censorship resistance. It‚Äôs not controlled by any one party like any other exchanges. You can download it <a href="https://bisq.network/">here</a>. From their <a href="https://docs.bisq.network/intro.html">about page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bisq‚Äôs mission is to provide a secure, private and censorship-resistant way of exchanging bitcoin for national currencies and other cryptocurrencies over the internet.</p>

  <p>When we say secure, we are referring to the safety of users‚Äô funds. Today, most bitcoin exchanges are centralized, requiring users to store their bitcoins‚Äî‚Äãfor at least some amount of time‚Äî‚Äãon exchange servers. When thousands of users do this, it creates extreme incentives for those servers to be hacked and for those users‚Äô bitcoins to be stolen. And time and time again these hacks and thefts are exactly what happen.</p>

  <p>When we say private, we are referring to users‚Äô ability to control access to their own information. Today, most centralized exchanges require users to divulge personally identifying information in order to set up an account, and then in turn link users‚Äô trading activity to their respective identities. This practice creates extreme risks for users that their personal details and financial information will be stolen, leaked or otherwise used against their own best interests.</p>

  <p>When we say censorship-resistant, we are referring to users‚Äô ability to voluntarily trade with one another without interference from a third party. Today, centralized bitcoin exchanges are highly susceptible to such interference. By their nature, they must operate within one legal jurisdiction or another, putting them at risk of being fined or shut down if they do not comply with the laws and other rules of that jurisdiction, which may include restrictions on who can trade and what can be traded, and almost always include requirements to collect personal information as described above.</p>

  <p>What‚Äôs needed is an exchange where users keep control of funds, that is private by default, and that defends freedom of transaction. We built Bisq to meet these needs.</p>

  <p>Where Bitcoin‚Äôs motto is ‚Äúbe your own bank,‚Äù Bisq‚Äôs is ‚Äúbe your own exchange.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I tried to show a couple of things in the book that I thought were important. Toussaint used ethics as a way to elevate the culture, to [build] common trust, common understanding, common principles. He ran an army that was much more ethical than the British, French, or Spanish armies. This is a guy who was a slave, [but] who had great support from the white women in Haiti for his efforts because he had such high ethical standards for soldiers.</p>

  <p>It was that ethical standard actually that led to the discipline that the army had that made it such an effective fighting force. I want to get that point across so that people would really understand the value of ethics beyond just needing to be a good person. Then the second part of it was, how do you actually implement that? How do you make it explicit? And how do you make it a priority even if it conflicts with your other priorities, which ethics often does. I wanted to get across that being ethical can be a strength.</p>

              <p>The <a href="/20191011/what-is-a-company.html">company system</a> is a mental model for modern knowledge-based organizations. It can be further simplified - a company is made of people systems (individuals and teams), and technical systems (products and markets).</p>

<p>Managing both can be an arduous task, and what most companies do at a certain stage is divide and conquer that responsibility through a ‚Äúmatrixed organization‚Äù. A certain portion of leadership is responsible for the individuals and teams, and another responsible for the business results of those teams.</p>

<p>This division of responsibility removes management overhead from business owners, and outcome overhead from people managers - but requires a strong culture of collaboration and information sharing to be successful as well. When it works, it works <em>really</em> well, and worth a continued investment to get it right. Matrixed orgs were also popularized through Andy Grove‚Äôs management bible, High Output Management.</p>

<p>That said, just like any organization design - matrixed orgs are only one framework, and companies should continue to go to first principles to re-evaluate and adjust according to how well things are working.</p>

              On The History of TV and The Future of Mobile
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve often said that mobile media today is where the American television industry was in the 60s. After WWII, American‚Äôs started buying televisions en masse. In 1942, there were 5000 televisions in American homes. By 1953, there were 20 million. That explosion is not dissimilar to the smartphone boom over the last 12 years. Decreased costs drove much of this. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_television#United_States">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Television usage in the western world skyrocketed after World War II with the lifting of the manufacturing freeze, war-related technological advances, the drop in television prices caused by mass production, increased leisure time, and additional disposable income.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt until the 60s that the cable and satellite television started emerging:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The development of cable television and satellite television in the 1970s allowed for more channels and encouraged businessmen to target programming toward specific audiences. It also enabled the rise of subscription television channels, such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime in the U.S., and Sky Television in the U.K.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took a while before the media industry caught up to the fact that television was a mainstream entertainment habit with very unique constraints, and that content needed to fit those constraints. This led to innovation like the 22 minute format with 8 minutes for advertising:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ää[The 22 minute format is] a concept that‚Äôs existed on network television since the 1950s, when televisions became a staple in the modern American home and advertisements were built into television‚Äôs DNA. I Love Lucy (1951‚Äì57) remains a quintessential sitcom of American television history, and its episodes were in that 23-to-27-minute range, supplemented by sponsored programming. Other shows‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääboth half-hour and hour-long programs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääexisted within a similar framework, when networks first sold advertising spots alongside its programs in the 1960s. For sitcoms like The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961‚Äì66) and Sanford and Son (1972‚Äì77), 22 to 24 minutes was par for the course. TV‚Äôs most legendary sitcoms of the past few decades‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCheers, Seinfeld, Frasier, Friends, the American version of The Office‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääalso created within the strictures of this framework [‚Ä¶] There‚Äôs a formula to 22-minute episodes that, perhaps in part because we‚Äôve been trained as viewers, produces extremely pleasing, comforting results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mobile is in the same place. In this first decade since the smartphone has emerged, it‚Äôs become the biggest channel across all media products - gaming, video, reading, music, and more.</p>

<p>But user entertainment habits on mobile are very different. More importantly, the capability of a mobile device allows for so much more than what existing content providers create. Essentially, mobile devices are highly <em>underleveraged</em> in terms of our entertainment options. There are many new studios and products that are changing this, and it‚Äôs amazing to see the change happening so quickly.</p>

              Learning about Quantum Computing
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Yesterday, Google made an <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/10/quantum-supremacy-using-programmable.html">announcement</a> about a breakthrough in Quantum computing. I don‚Äôt know much about this topic but it was being discussed by a number of people I respect, so this is a self-serving learning post.</p>

<p>Some learnings so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quantum is a hypothetical model of computation. Compared to classical computing in which <em>memory</em> is represented in ‚Äúbits‚Äù as 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs (a <em>bit</em> is the smallest unit of data in a computer), quantum memory stores a <em>quantum state</em>.</li>
  <li>Quantum states are represented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">qubits</a>, basic unit of quantum information. There are two possible outcomes for the measurement of a qubit‚Äîusually taken to have the value ‚Äú0‚Äù and ‚Äú1‚Äù, like a bit or binary digit. However, whereas the state of a bit can only be either 0 or 1, the general state of a qubit according to quantum mechanics can be a coherent superposition of both. Moreover, whereas a measurement of a classical bit would not disturb its state, a measurement of a qubit would destroy its coherence and irrevocably disturb the superposition state. It is possible to fully encode one bit in one qubit.</li>
  <li>Quantum Supremacy is the concept of a crossover point, at which it becomes impossible to do something without representing and computing with quantum states.</li>
  <li>If we compute using the rules of quantum mechanics, instead of binary logic, some intractable computational tasks become feasible. An important goal in the pursuit of a universal quantum computer is the determination of the smallest computational task that is prohibitively hard for today‚Äôs classical computers.</li>
  <li>Google announced that it has created a 53-qubit processor. The computational task was to sample the output of a pseudo random quantum circuit and perform some operation on it that is really difficult for a classical computer to do. Each sample is represented by a bit-string (e.g. 1100011, 1010101, etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôll update this as my understanding of this topic increases.</p>

              <p>Ben Thomson from Stratechery penned <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">a thoughtful piece</a> on the recent Facebook announcement and following discussion. His piece goes through the fundamental changes the internet has created in the world of news media, and some opposing concerns: that Facebook has <em>too much power</em>, and that Facebook doesn‚Äôt to <em>exert its power</em> when it comes to politically motivated misinformation. In abstract terms, that conflict is clear, but the reality is Facebook is not a neutral platform and it <em>is</em> choosing to exercise it‚Äôs power in many other ways. For it to take this stance is, <a href="/20191020/facebook.html">as I mentioned</a> a clear reflection of it‚Äôs values.</p>

<p>From Ben‚Äôs piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact of the matter is that the world is fundamentally changing, just as it did five hundred years ago. At the same time, that change will take time ‚Äî the printing press was invented in Germany in 1440 and yet German unification did not happen until 1871 ‚Äî and will be guided by choices we make along the way. The sooner we recognize that transformation is coming, the more readily we can reject authoritarian attempts to hold onto the world as it was, and create the world we want to see.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Parenting is rewarding, but it‚Äôs all-consuming. There‚Äôs no time that‚Äôs more obvious than the weekend. I‚Äôve found a really good system to fall back on during the weekday, but weekend schedules tend to devolve pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Much of it comes down to how the day starts. And the problem with weekends is that they typically start inconsistently, or without any space for personal time.</p>

<p>Someone mentioned recently they used a morning workout to <em>anchor their day</em>. I like that analogy. It implies that it can‚Äôt swing about wildly, which is what weekends often feel like. By Sunday I‚Äôm craving that <em>routine</em> again. Perhaps that ebb and flow is a necessary weekly rhythm. For now, I look for joy by embracing the chaos.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Canada is going to the elections tomorrow. It‚Äôs been more polarizing than <em>normal</em>, whatever that even means these days. Social media has it on full display.</p>

<p>Facebook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919223/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-speech-live-politics-threats-free-expression">announced</a> that it will not ban poltical ads that contain known falsehoods, in defense of <em>free speech</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the sensitivity around political ads, I‚Äôve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether. From a business perspective, the controversy certainly isn‚Äôt worth the small part of our business they make up. But political ads are an important part of voice ‚Äî especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, Mark.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs rewind to 2016 - a fucked up year by most standards. Trump was elected, and even Mark admitted he didn‚Äôt anticipate nor fully accept responsibility for all the things that happen on his platform. First there was that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-blamed-trump-election-mark-zuckerberg-response-tone-deaf-2016-11">tone-deaf denial</a>. In their defense, they later started <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/12/15/facebook-responsibility/">taking responsibility</a>. So after three long years of doing that, hiring <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pazmgy/facebook-is-hiring-1000-more-people-to-block-fake-news-ads">thousands</a> to combat the issue, it just feels just so strange that we ended up here.</p>

<p>All for this ridiculous fear that Facebook will no longer be a place for <em>free speech</em>. Newsflash: it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/">never was</a>. Facebook is many things - but <em>neutral</em> is definitely not one of them.</p>

<p>Facebook <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/10/mark-zuckerberg-stands-for-voice-and-free-expression/">said</a> ‚Äúfocusing on authenticity and verifying accounts is a much better solution than an ever-expanding definition of what speech is harmful.‚Äù Here‚Äôs how I read that: ‚ÄúWe will block fake news from fake accounts. But real people, especially those real people that benefit the most from fake news - they‚Äôre cool. They can stay. Infact, we‚Äôll take their money and promote them.‚Äù</p>

<p>Conversations defending Facebook‚Äôs right to exercise American values on a global platform (don‚Äôt get me started) revolve around how Facebook is <em>so different</em>. That‚Äôs true along many dimensions. User generated content at scale changes the game in significant ways.</p>

<p>But here‚Äôs the crux of it. The finely tuned economic engine for Facebook behaves like a publisher. Not only is it taking advertiser money, it‚Äôs also exercising broad editorial standards. Just like a publisher. These are significant truths, albeit inconvenient for Facebook.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how this all <em>feels</em>. Mark doesn‚Äôt like what Facebook is today. He wants it to be a place where free speech can flourish, and hopefully not damage democracy in the process. But doing one without the other - that‚Äôs messy work. People work. Not high-gross-margin-platform-business work. And after years of effort trying to make it all, well, work‚Ä¶the answers still aren‚Äôt clear. Idealism is all that‚Äôs left.</p>

<p>Except it‚Äôs nowhere near enough. Here‚Äôs what bothers me the most - If you accept responsibility for something, you have to do it <em>fully</em>. Commit to it, for the long term. And if you don‚Äôt want to take it on - <strong>that‚Äôs fine too</strong>. Just don‚Äôt say one thing and do another.</p>

              <p>Ben Horowitz published a short but powerful <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/17/how-to-be-effective-ceo-leader/">post</a> about the mindset of a founder / CEO.</p>

<p>On how being a founder means your temperament is tied to company ups and downs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When you found a company, it tends to get wired into your nervous system. I used to become physically ill whenever there was something wrong in the company ‚Äî even if I didn‚Äôt know what it was. Even if I couldn‚Äôt see it, I could feel it. It wasn‚Äôt a pleasant feeling. Most good founder/CEOs that I know have this same, gnarly experience. Unfortunately, feeling it turns out to be the easy part of the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On that dreaded feeling that only a CEO can truly internalize:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your last round‚Äôs valuation was high and valuations have fallen. Your topline growth is a bit lower than expected and your spend rate is as planned. You can feel that‚Äôs going to be a big problem. Do you intellectualize it away? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a great new product release coming and we‚Äôve gotten great press lately. We can make it up this quarter‚Äù or do you run towards the terrifying situation and try to figure it out now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On what seperates the good from the bad:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Which way you run is often the key differentiator between effective and ineffective CEOs. Almost all CEOs know where the problems are, but only the truly elite ones run towards the fear.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The abstract definition of a ‚Äúlearning community‚Äù is a collective of individuals working towards some academic or skill development. Typically, there‚Äôs a cycle of collaborative and individual work (in academia, class and homework) and a cohort-based structure.</p>

<p>This definition applies well to startups too. The stages of a startup create a natural cohort structure too. Employees often ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù out of their roles within 2-3 years, and seek opportunities to learn either in the later stage organization, or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Startups should consider themselves learning communities with that have a common outcome. After all, in the knowledge economy, the raw ingredients for any startup is people. The most successful startups are known for their business results <em>and</em> their infrastructure for personal growth. This takes intentionality, a good relationship with failure and learning, all of which needs to be supported at leadership level. It‚Äôs a long term investment.</p>

<p>So much attention about the ‚ÄúFuture of Work‚Äù goes to the collaboration problems, but there‚Äôs more unlocked value in solving the higher order problems.</p>

              <p>With private markets awash with capital, there are so many new venture funds that have been created in the last few years. One of the models I‚Äôve been really interested in is the startup studio model - a firm that builds companies by actively testing a specific thesis or idea. Some studios focus on novel ideas, others create clones for underserved markets. Some build operating teams, others just look to create the founding team. <a href="https://medium.com/global-startup-studio-network/the-origin-and-evolution-of-the-startup-studio-3e442c35d21">This article</a> goes through the evolution of the model and lists some of the most popular studios operating today, as well as their approach to the model.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a really interesting take and another example of venture taking different forms, especially in early stages of company formation. Sometimes the studio environment is perfect for a startup or team, and other times it won‚Äôt work. That said, while there isn‚Äôt any quantifiable evidence that it convincingly works better than the current venture model (atleast not yet), it‚Äôs really healthy to see funds playing experimenting with how they add value in different ways.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Our perception is generally tuned towards the problems we see around us. It‚Äôs easy to become apathetic towards everything that‚Äôs going <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>When those problems are [relatively] small, we can still see the forest for the trees and keep moving. But sometimes, we encounter problems that are seemingly so large that they appear as roadblocks preventing us from moving forward.</p>

<p>One of the tools I‚Äôve found useful in those cases is creating a broader perspective - trying to look at your world in different domains - family, friends, lifestyle, career, your physical and mental capabilities. This is not for the sake of balancing - finding what‚Äôs good in one domain seldom counteracts what‚Äôs not great in another. It‚Äôs the awareness of the problem in the context of <em>everything else</em> makes it more manageable.</p>

<p>This level of awareness seems to build naturally when establishing a daily routine. Having a system to fall back on helps to anchor your day, and the result is a more calm outlook towards any problems you have - no matter their size.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I recently listened to a discussion about food technology on CBC Radio, and the upcoming disruption of the entire agricultural farming industry.</p>

<p>The alternative food sector is seeing explosive growth, and brands like Impossible Burgers and Beyond Meat are a big part of the narrative. But the core of this disruption is research to synthetically create the actual proteins found in popular foods. This means that whether it‚Äôs coffee, or steak, or even milk - all of this will be producible synthetically and at a higher quality than factory farming.</p>

<p>This part is particularly interesting, from <a href="https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture#food-and-agriculture-download">Rethinking Food and Agriculture</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The current industrialized, animal-agriculture system will be replaced with a Food-as-Software model, where foods are engineered by scientists at a molecular level and uploaded to databases that can be accessed by food designers anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, this process costs thousands of dollars to create. But those cost curves are decreasing rapidly, and soon most burgers will be produced in a factory. Disruption theory is taking place in the food industry, and it‚Äôs pretty incredible. This also mirrors the evolution of the <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/the-history-and-future-of-plastics">synthetic plastics industry</a> in the early 1900‚Äôs.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This morning, I had an amazing conversation with a good friend about his new venture. The topic went in many directions, but we talked for a while about company building and leadership.</p>

<p>I asked a question that I‚Äôve asked myself in my quest to learn how to become a more effective leader - <em>what is a company</em>? It led to a short diatribe about the current state of leadership advice, which ultimately led to answering the question. I‚Äôm documenting it here, for future reference.</p>

<p>Leadership advice surrounds us in the tech community. It‚Äôs everywhere. It‚Äôs amazing that people from different companies at different stages are openly sharing their lessons in an effort to make us better. But that‚Äôs made for information overload. The problem of ‚Äúpopular advice‚Äù has never been worse. Popularity is a horrible proxy for many things, but especially so for advice. It creates recency bias and results in misapplying tactics.</p>

<p>The conclusion I‚Äôve reached is leadership advice needs to be received with more structure. All advice needs a mental framework in our minds, so we can use the right tools for the right jobs.</p>

<p>That framework for me is the company system - people, organizing as teams, creating some output, received by a market, which done enough, produces impact. It translates the line between an individual and impact. There‚Äôs nuance around governance and company stage that needs to be considered, but for the most part the simple structure is an incredibly useful mental model.</p>

<p>This simple framework also helps me place advice, and I look to challenge it everytime I learn something new (reading a new book, or a blog post).</p>

              On &#39;The China Cultural Clash&#39;

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Ben Thompson writes about tech and strategy, but recently wrote about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/">the NBA‚Äôs rift with China</a>. I really enjoyed reading this one. These are some of my favorite captions:</p>

<p>On the fact that <strong>this isn‚Äôt new</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is that the U.S. China relationship has been extremely one-sided for a very long time now: China buys the hardware it needs, and keeps all of the software opportunities for itself ‚Äî and, of course, pursues software opportunities abroad.</p>

  <p>This understated the case: not only were Chinese companies allowed into the U.S. while U.S. companies remained locked out of China, Chinese attacks on U.S. tech companies were allowed by China‚Äôs censors, and in fact even augmented by the Great Firewall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This point is interesting. We worry about Chinese censorship of US content <em>in China</em>, but we need to think of the reverse - US residents being censored within their own countries by a foreign government. This is especially true with the rise of tech startups with Chinese ownership (like TikTok) that have become popular globally.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This should raise serious concern in the United States and other Western countries: is it at all acceptable to have a social network that has a demonstrated willingness to censor content under the control of a country that has clearly different views on what constitutes free speech?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On his personal conflict and the impetus for companies to choose morals over money:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am not particularly excited to write this article. My instinct is towards free trade, my affinity for Asia generally and Greater China specifically, my welfare enhanced by staying off China‚Äôs radar. And yet, for all that the idea of being a global citizen is an alluring concept and largely my lived experience, I find in situations like this that I am undoubtedly a child of the West. I do believe in the individual, in free speech, and in democracy, no matter how poorly practiced in the United States or elsewhere. And, in situations like this weekend, when values meet money, <strong>I worry just how many companies are capable of choosing the former?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the broader moral conflict:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The biggest, shift, though, is a mindset one. First, the Internet is an amoral force that reduces friction, not an inevitable force for good. Second, sometimes different cultures simply have fundamentally different values. Third, if values are going to be preserved, they must be a leading factor in economic entanglement, not a trailing one. This is the point that Clinton got the most wrong: money, like tech, is amoral. If we insist it matters most our own morals will inevitably disappear.</p>

              <p>I didn‚Äôt get much sleep yesterday. At this point in my life, not getting a full night‚Äôs rest shows up clearly the next day. It was never a badge of honor, but now it‚Äôs a clear hindrance.</p>

<p>I was reminded of <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/entrepreneurs-who-sleep-more-are-better-at-spotting-good-ideas">this HBR article</a> about how entrepreneurs who sleep more are better at spotting good ideas:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Business ideas are plentiful, and pursuing the wrong idea early-on can hamstring an entrepreneur‚Äôs efforts to launch a venture. An early misstep might even be the difference between becoming a successful entrepreneur and failure. Far from being a sign of weaknesses, sleep can serve as an early-stage aid to effectively evaluate the myriad business opportunities to pursue. Sleeping at the right times, such as the night before ideation and evaluation tasks, will improve outcomes.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>We‚Äôre divided on so many fronts these days. One of them is whether our online expressions should become immediately accountable.</p>

<p>When we publish something on the internet or tweet something to our followers, we immediately have an <em>audience</em> for those thoughts. That carries a sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>There are those that argue one shouldn‚Äôt concern themselves with the audience‚Äôs reaction - express the thought, act on them, see them through to their fullest extent. Life is an experiment and we need fearlessness to move society forward.</p>

<p>Then there are those that argue that we <em>must</em> read the room. We cannot act with reckless abandon, and that people with leverage have an inherent responsibility.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt a new problem, but the rise of influencer culture has magnified it and made it a mainstream issue. On one side, the most powerful person in the world is openly acting like an asshole on Twitter. On another side, people are feeling censored and attacked for their thoughts, and choosing to stay silent.</p>

<p>The problem I see is intelligent people ignoring nuance, stuck in simplistic and uninformed mental models. People acting childishly, not understanding the leverage of their mediums and expressions.</p>

<p>Maybe we‚Äôll get to a place where we‚Äôll be able to have decent social discourse and be able to grow together, but recognizing there are some just beginning that process. Perhaps that will just take time.</p>

              Don&#39;t Raise More Than You Need
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>It‚Äôs generally good advice for companies to only raise the amount of capital for what‚Äôs absolutely necessary, and no more. The definition of <em>necessary</em> is context specific, but most often it‚Äôs getting through a certain stage or getting ready for a future investment round, IPO, or another milestone.</p>

<p>When you raise too little, obviously that can handicap a companies ability to reach these goals. When raising too much, decision quality suffers - companies choose to do <em>more</em> and prioritize less. This leads to a decline in output quality - be it in product, sales, or any business leading function. Startups often tend to spend what they raise, and being overcapitalized leads to saying yes to everything. Ofcourse, there is also the issue of over-valuing your company too early and the difficulty in raising another round in that situation. These and other issues are discussed in Mark Suster‚Äôs article from 2016, <a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-raising-too-much-money-can-harm-your-startup-5adc112e1259">Why Raising Too Much Money Can Harm Your Startup</a>.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, this applies not just to companies but to VC funds too. There weren‚Äôt that many examples of the counter argument before but now there‚Äôs Softbank‚Äôs Vision Fund, obviously an easy target these days. Excess capital clouds decision making, especially you‚Äôre in the sole business of deploying capital. It obviously affects the leading fund, but also other investors as well.</p>

<p>At a time when funds are awash with capital, Softbank is probably not the only outlier, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time until the hens come home to roost.</p>

              Some Notes on Three Big Things
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Human history seems to be a popular topic to write about these days. Maybe it‚Äôs the Sapiens effect, or just the amount of change that‚Äôs happening in the world. People want to know what‚Äôs next, and are looking to the past for answers.</p>

<p>Morgan Housel just published <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/three-big-things-the-most-important-forces-shaping-the-world/">Three Big Things</a>, is one of the best essays I‚Äôve read recently on the topic of human history. It talks about how much of what we experience is a second, third and n-th order effect from some <em>big things</em> that happened many years ago. Our modern society, for example, has largely been shaped by the events of World War II. Our current norms of personal finance, military strategy, and even civil rights are a result of the war.</p>

<p>There are three other big things that he discusses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A shift in demographics: Modern society is aging, people are living longer, working longer and having fewer kids. Immigrants will make their way to become the majority. These changes will be the most important factors shaping economic output in the upcoming decades. Want to know which economies will fare well? Observe the demographics.</li>
  <li>The breaking point for wealth inequality: The wealth gap has never been worse, and there‚Äôs a cyclical trend at play - the pendulum will start to swing the other way as masses lose trust in economic and political systems. Morgan states, ‚Äú‚Ä¶power is transitory. It shifts when those who don‚Äôt have it get so fed up that they bond together to gain enough influence to take it back. Never underestimate the power of a unified group of powerless people with a shared goal.‚Äù There will be a disruption in education, an increase in entrepreneurs, and new systems will be built along the way. It is a time to be optimistic.</li>
  <li>Realizing the full potential of the internet: Access to information has changed the dynamics of how society works. Whether it‚Äôs solving a crime or finding a life partner, we are just scratching the surface of what‚Äôs possible when there‚Äôs an ever present information layer in our daily lives. While this will do a lot of good - more nuance in our understanding of the world, meritocracy that actually works - there are also some big, unsolved problems, such as the loss of privacy and spreading misinformation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing about these trends is <em>new</em>. That‚Äôs the whole point - we are so fascinated by the new that we miss out on the tidal waves that we are already on. This essay brings that into perspective so well.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>There is a time to trust the system and there‚Äôs a time to own your destiny.</p>

<p>The system gives us comfort and a <em>sense</em> of community. Everyone needs some kind of system they trust. We have built incredible political, religous, financial, medical and social systems in the name of progress. And along many dimensions, there <em>has</em> been incredible progress. These systems all work together in a complex ways and often seem random when observed on short time scales. Taking a step back we see that most systems follow some kind of cyclical pattern.</p>

<p>But not all is well. Our systems have given us convenience, but in some places have removed our individualism. Ironically, they have given us many individual comforts, but made us collectively weaker in some places.</p>

<p>Right now, from where I stand, I‚Äôm observing a collective questioning of <em>all of our systems</em>. While the action is not abnormal, the scale and scope of it is. People are losing trust in <em>everything</em>, even though it‚Äôs not immediately obvious. And as a result, we‚Äôre seeing new systems being formed, and many of them are focused on helping people <em>own their destiny</em>.</p>

<p>Whether it‚Äôs owning your data, helping people become entrepreneurs, or changing the core units of monetary value - everything is being shaken up. In 10 years, we will look to this brief period as a critical juncture in human history.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúWe are all going to die.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember when Jeremie Saunders said this during his talk at TEDxToronto from a few years ago. At the time, Jeremie was 29 years old, and was three months away from his <em>prescribed</em> date of death due to Cystic Fibrosis. I can‚Äôt nearly do it justice, so here is the talk in full:</p>

<iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQniNh_6LOY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Some of my favorite passages and quotes:</p>

<p>On death and freedom:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Cystic Fibrosis is one of the best things that have happened to me. No longer does that sentence - ‚ÄúCystic Fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease‚Äù - carry the weight of fear, rejection and anger. Instead it‚Äôs become this powerful source of inspiration - <strong>it drives me</strong>. You see, my unavoidable fate opened up my eyes so wide that it fundamentally changed what it means to live day in and day out, moment to moment. Cystic Fibrosis has essentially given me the impetus to not only <em>accept</em> my own mortality, but to <em>embrace</em> my own mortality. With that comes this extraordinary sense of freedom. And I can take that freedom and sprinkle it into my life by living like nothing is unattainable. I can take that big scary concept of death and instead of fear it, Use it, as a tool to motivate myself to live life to the fullest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On living fully, a quote from Mark Twain:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeremie is an incredible human and continues to share his message through his podcast Sickboy, about others who live with chronic or terminal illness, in order to destigmatize illness and build community for those who are sick. Check it out <a href="http://sickboypodcast.com/">here</a>.</p>

              Antifragile Marketplaces
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve had a few conversations recently about the concept of anti fragility as it applies to marketplaces.</p>

<p>Antifragility is a concept that any entity actually gets stronger as a result of shock, or damage. It can be applied in business, medicine, systems design and more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting thought exercise is how we can design our marketplaces to be antifragile by nature. The shocks can be the loss of entities on any side. For example, the loss of a supplier, or exodus of customers. Can a marketplace actually get better if a supplier is lost, or goes out of business? In decentralized marketplaces (like Teachable or Shopify), this is precisely what happens. It actually improves the quality bar of overall suppliers on the platform. Exodus of customers is similar in decentralized marketplaces - because the damage is limited to one supplier - and an exodus of customers can be a good sign that supplier shouldn‚Äôt be in business.</p>

<p>I think we‚Äôre going to see a lot more of these types of decentralized marketplaces in the future and it will be good for everyone.</p>

              <p>As more tech IPO‚Äôs tank, it‚Äôs clear that public market investors are not reacting well to the potential of the hottest companies in tech today. They want real margins that can sustain businesses in the long run.</p>

<p>Fred Wilson wrote an excellent <a href="https://avc.com/2019/09/the-great-public-market-reckoning/">piece</a> on this recently, and cited a post I‚Äôve seen referred to often, <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2011/05/24/all-revenue-is-not-created-equal-the-keys-to-the-10x-revenue-club/">All Revenue is Not Created Equal</a>. From the post is an excellent description of how valuation should differ based on the margins in a business:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a huge difference between companies with high gross margins and those with lower gross margins. Using the DCF framework, you cannot generate much cash from a revenue stream that is saddled with large, variable costs. As a result, lower gross margin companies will trade a highly discounted price/revenue multiples. All things being equal, gross margin percentage should have a direct impact on price/revenue multiple, as there will obviously be more gross margin dollars to contribute to free cash flow. Journalists who quickly apply 10x multiples to all private companies should at the very least consider gross margin levels in their analysis.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another great post on this topic, that I‚Äôve referred to in the past as well, is Tren Wilson‚Äôs post, <a href="https://25iq.com/2017/02/04/gross-margin-for-fun-and-profit-involves-beer-and-music-streaming/">Gross Margin for Fun and Profit</a>.</p>

              <p>I‚Äôm writing a more comprehensive essay on the role software is playing in society. This post is a set of highly disconnected points I want to make in that essay.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inherently software is an infinitely moldable, interactive, and updateable object.</li>
  <li>Software is plastic. It has an infinite creative space, and will soon become everything. When that happens, it will also become <em>invisible</em>.</li>
  <li>AI helps software create patterns - patterns that help us see, hear, and create.</li>
  <li>People who make software need to deeply understand the spoken and unspoken needs of the people.</li>
  <li>People who make software must accept both the first and second order effects of what they are creating, especially given how easy it is to distribute and get people‚Äôs attention.</li>
  <li>Software is eating the world - first by <em>modelling it</em>, then by creating something that only exist only in software. This is a consistent pattern that applies in many scenarios and industries.</li>
  <li>Software is becoming closer to us. We are already wearing software, driving software, and living in software.</li>
  <li>Software is starting to solve some higher order human functions - we learn, meditate, and empathize with software. But we don‚Äôt have software-native ways to do those things, yet.</li>
  <li>What happens when software has finished eating the world? What do we have to watch out for? Technologists love to extrapolate potential but software‚Äôs place in society will likely be more balanced and neutral.</li>
</ul>

              <p>Amazon announced it‚Äôs echo buds recently, creating a low priced Airpods competitor tied to the Alexa ecosystem. The relatively low pricepoint ($130) can skyrocket adoption.</p>

<p>A few months ago I wrote about how we are <a href="/20190129/closer-software.html">getting closer to software</a>. While Echobuds aren‚Äôt novel, it‚Äôs just another development in bringing software closer to our physical selves.</p>

<p>I also happened to talk to a student from <a href="https://theksociety.com/">The Knowledge Society</a>, an incubator for some brilliant high school students - who was investigating the world of 3D printed organs, gene editing and CRISPR. This is how software is eating the world from the inside out.</p>

<p>Technologists love to extrapolate potential, but mass adoption is often a multi-decade sport. But at the same time, our future already exists in today‚Äôs science fiction. It‚Äôs wild to think about our world in twenty or thirty years.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Social Finance
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Yesterday Anish Acharya published this post entitled <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/09/24/how-fintech-startups-find-users/">Five Ways Fintech Companies can find Customers</a>.</p>

<p>One of the tactics he mentioned was activating social networks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Social networks have been largely underutilized in fintech thus far. But existing social bonds can be a powerful tool used to encourage saving and extend credit‚ÄîROSCAs are an age-old (offline) example. Looking ahead, a16z general partner Connie Chan recently wrote about the use of WhatsApp and WeChat groups in China to facilitate product experiences in travel, shopping, fitness, and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two layers to social finance. One leans on the dynamics in which money moves between people. This encompasses everything from peer to peer transfers to shared savings pools (the ROSCAs referred to above).</p>

<p>The second is simply adding a social layer on top of the current financial services, that encourages people to be more open about matters of money. This includes safe spaces to ask others about money (Reddit‚Äôs finance forums, for example - although I wouldn‚Äôt broadly classify Reddit as a safe space), but also things like <a href="https://www.meetcleo.com/">cheeky financial advice chat bots</a> that are fun to share.</p>

<p>Our relationships with money are complicated, and many seek social validation to make sure they‚Äôre on the right track. For most, being a part of the right pack is exactly what they need. Financial advisors provide this ability but there‚Äôs so much more room for experimentation here.</p>

      <p>The Performance Zone, where the key metric is to make the number. It consists of the sales organizations accountable for bookings and the product and service organizations accountable for revenue‚Äîand no one else.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Productivity Zone, where success means delivering efficient systems and effective programs while ensuring all operations are regulatory compliant. Virtually everyone who is not directly accountable for a booking or revenue number works here.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Incubation Zone, where the objective is to make, market, and sell products and services that are highly disruptive to the status quo. These efforts are deliberately kept sequestered from the prior two zones to speed cycle time, embrace innovation, and take risk. Success here consists of creating viable businesses in net new uncorrelated categories that can be scaled to material size.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Transformation Zone, where success equates either to driving an incubated business to material scale or fending off a direct attack on a core business model. In either case an initiative in this zone takes priority over all activities in the other three zones, and they must make whatever adjustments necessary to accommodate it.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The first 3 are fairly well understood. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù and ‚ÄúProductivity‚Äù are relevant to sustaining innovation - either extracting maximum value from a market, or for enabling functions. The Incubation zone efforts are the lab-type efforts that exist in almost every enterprise.</p>

<p>So, to say that big companies can‚Äôt innovate isn‚Äôt really true. Most big companies work well in Zone 1 and 2. They also invest in Zone 3, to address the disruptive forces themselves.</p>

<p>In his presentation, he highlighted cases from 56 companies that were once market leaders, all had innovation labs, but never were able to counter the disruptive forces working against them.</p>

<p>The main reason, in all those organizations, was the lack of a ‚Äútransformation‚Äù zone type effort. In this zone, companies move into <em>war time</em> mode to ensure that the successful incubated projects are actualized into the rest of the company. Most companies fail at this - even successful incubated projects either struggle to integrate with the rest of the organization / product line. In this zone, everyone in the organization needs to be <em>focused</em> on making this transformation successful, which can sometimes mean sacrificing short term revenue targets for revenue growth potential.</p>

<p>A few examples are Apple‚Äôs focus on the iPod (when the Mac was making it the most money), and Microsoft‚Äôs recent shift to cloud computing (so dramatic that there‚Äôs no longer a Windows division in the company).</p>

Banks with excessive fees and loan providers with excessive interest are making this problem so much worse. Earnin provides a no-fee service that gives people access to capital as soon as they work, so they don‚Äôt have to wait until the biweekly Friday pay-cycle. The notion of a ‚Äòpayday‚Äô means that companies are withholding access to money so that <em>they</em> can put it to work versus the people it‚Äôs owed to.

<p>This made me think about some of the cycles that modern society is seemingly stuck in. Some that are top of mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The daily 9-5 cycle, created as a by-product of the industrial revolution but no longer relevant in a knowledge economy. Within this is also the daily commute cycle, a 2-3 hour block of lost productivity.</li>
  <li>The cycle of higher education as the only path to unlock success</li>
  <li>The cycle of reactive, symptom-focused care perpetuated by the modern medical industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some are norms that have been perfected for years for us to inherit. But, the internet has given us infrastructure to pass information and value in real time, so it‚Äôs time to apply first-principles thinking and think of the best solutions to these problems.</p>

              Some Notes on the Bill Gates Documentary
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The Bill Gates documentary series was released on Netflix on Friday. It‚Äôs a behind-the-scenes look at Bill‚Äôs life - focusing on his work at the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, but also covers his childhood, his work at Microsoft, reading habits and much more. It‚Äôs pretty fascinating, and I will probably watch it a few times. This is a post of a few things I took away from the documentary.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Gates is a first principles thinker.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When designing the next generation <em>toilet</em>, he approaches the problem with a few unchangable restrictions. In this case, it‚Äôs the current conditions of the places where these toilets are needed the most - especially the lack of electricity and running water. The foundation ran a contest to encourage innovation around a toilet that doesn‚Äôt require running water, access to electricity, and where the byproduct can be re-used instead of being dumped into rivers and lakes. These next generation toilets are being produced and deployed around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bill Gates uses mental models for everything.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Melinda Gates says it best - ‚Äú[Bill] makes a framework in his mind, and then starts slotting in the information. If something doesn‚Äôt line up, he gets very frustrated.‚Äù He uses frameworks to understand complex topics and then devours as much information as he can to complete that model. Mental models create simple structures to understand the real world, which are essential to linking the facts together. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs most often the smartest guy in the room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are so many other learnings - on the habits he‚Äôs formed to devour and retain information, his sense of competition, and also the incredible privelege that allowed for him to explore his interests throughout his life.</p>

              Some Notes on The Passive Investing Bubble
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve read a few articles recently about the bubble in passive investing. It started with Michael Burry declaring that index investing is a bubble similar to the collateralized debt obligations (CDO‚Äôs) that brought down the global economy in 2007. The simple premise is that ETF‚Äôs mostly invest in larger companies, and small cap stocks are being thereby being ‚Äúneglected‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As money pours into exchange-traded funds and other index-tracking products that skew toward big companies, Burry says smaller value stocks are being unduly neglected around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ben Hunt from <a href="www.epsilontheory.com">Epsilon Theory</a> points out the bias in that statement in his article, <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/ive-got-a-secret/">I‚Äôve Got a Secret</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Burry ‚Äì like every small cap value investor since the dawn of time ‚Äì is saying that the market doesn‚Äôt appreciate the information <strong>he‚Äôs</strong> uncovered about his small cap value stocks, and that there are structural reasons why the market doesn‚Äôt appreciate that information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to say the bubble is in the prevailing ‚Äúalways be buying‚Äù mentality that surrounds passive investment strategies. That strategy states - passive investing always beats active investing, that stocks always goes up in the long term, buying and holding for the long term without picking individual stocks is your best bet.</p>

<p>While this is true <em>today</em>, it may not <em>always</em> be true. Passive investment is not a way to shortcut independent thinking.</p>

<p>What is different about today‚Äôs stock market that didn‚Äôt really exist even 10 years ago is the volume of investment information and commentary (thanks to Twitter), and the ease of participating in the market (thanks to so many fintechs). At a macro level the narrative makes sense: that the contrarian path is to move away from passive vehicles, because everyone already knows that‚Äôs the best form.</p>

<p>Wealthfront also recently published the <a href="https://blog.wealthfront.com/the-myth-of-the-passive-investing-bubble/">Myth of the Passive Investment Bubble</a>, and referenced an <a href="https://blog.wealthfront.com/indexing-worse-than-marxism/">earlier article</a> from 2016, which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be sure, index investors are free riders.  They do receive the benefits that result from active trading without bearing the costs.  But free riding on price signals provided by others is hardly a flaw of the capitalist system; it is an essential feature of that system.  In a free-market economy we all benefit from relying on a set of market prices that are determined by others.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Question <em>quality</em> is a good signal to measure progress whenever learning something new. As we begin to understand something more - whether it‚Äôs a new language, skill or domain - the questions we ask about the unknowns in that domain become more specific and in most senses, better.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found this especially true when learning code. Initially, I start trying to solve problems by asking general questions like ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt this button do this thing that I want it to?‚Äù. It‚Äôs difficult to find answers to questions like that, and often leads to dead ends. When that‚Äôs happening enough, that‚Äôs a great signal that maybe I don‚Äôt understand the <em>basics</em> of a specific domain as well as I should. Often this happens because of an incomplete glossary or understanding of the larger system in which my code is operating. When I develop that, my questions become more precise, stack traces become more understandable, and answers become easier to find.</p>

<p>While this learning ability is relevant to code, it applies in almost very domain, and I often end up assessing my question quality as a measure of how well I understand something.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Risk
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The Big Short is one of my favorite movies. Such great storytelling about the different dimensions of the financial collapse in 2007, told through the lens of a prescient few that actually benefitted from the crisis.</p>

<p>It reminded me a bit of what‚Äôs going on in today‚Äôs economic environment where capital is at an all time high, reflected in frothy valuations across private and public markets. There are a lot of signals that the party is going to end soon, but who knows. I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball.</p>

<p>It also made me think about the fragility of centralized institutions - corporations and governments alike. Businesses operate trying to maintaining an equilibrium between supply and demand to keep innovating. Governments feel permanent but are also just constructed institutions that have real flaws. Right now, many governments are waking up to a threat to their sovereignty that they have never dealt with before - delvaluation of their money due to decentralized cryptocurrencies. Libra has actually done them a favor in attaching a singular body to the face of global cryptocurrency, and governments around the world are now actively blocking it through regulation. Bitcoin, created over a decade ago, still grows strong because there isn‚Äôt any one target to block.</p>

<p>Above all, in the face of upcoming risk, the safest place to be is a place of <em>self awareness</em> and <em>self reliance</em>, to a place of personal antifragility. We can weather any storm when our futures are not tied to those of a larger institution.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A few disconnected throughts about the concept of company secrets and open startups.</p>

<p>Companies are sharing more than they ever have before. Companies are openly sharing their best practices. Open source is the foundation upon which startups today are built. Patents are somewhat irrelevant for software startups.</p>

<p>The notion of ‚Äúcompany secrets‚Äù is dated in the world of the open internet. I‚Äôll go so far as to say companies often just hold <em>paper secrets</em> protected by NDA‚Äôs that aren‚Äôt really enforcable. This includes everything from internal practices, technology to financial secrets.</p>

<p>Information flows freely in private and public channels. Infact, CEO‚Äôs are the new celebrities, openly talking about how their organizations work on Twitter.</p>

<p>Open startups have embraced this shift, infact using openness as an opportunity for increased accountability. There is more benefit from being open than not, and open can even become a competitive advantage when it‚Äôs compounded over time. I think of companies like <a href="https://www.basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> - built on open source technology they founded, and to this day actively sharing their best practices.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, enterprise software hasn‚Äôt modelled this construct just yet, or atleast at scale. Slack is doing this this with shared channels, but for some reason that hasn‚Äôt really taken off. Creating an environment of learning together, especially between trusted organizations, I believe is a powerful one.</p>

              <p>A16 recently published a <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/09/06/china-is-cashing-in-on-group-chats/">post</a> on how Chinese companies are using group chat interfaces for everything from customer service, education, commerce and travel. It makes a lot of sense. Group chats are often trusted digital spaces full of high-intent users, often because they self select to become a part of the group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From chatbots to shopping via smart speaker, previous modes of conversational commerce have largely failed to live up to the hype in the US. But perhaps the reason is not that we are still waiting for next-generation technology; rather, we‚Äôve been viewing commerce too narrowly, as an individual experience. Group chats set up by businesses don‚Äôt have to feel transactional; to users, such chats can feel more like interest groups than one-on-one sales pitches. They can provide community and crowdsourced knowledge in an organic way while simultaneously helping the brand behind them build trust and sell products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Group chats are already huge in India. Whatsapp has optimized for communication to flow between group chats - accelerated by a very prominent ‚Äúforward‚Äù button on images and video. Information spreads between groups so things can spread exponentially faster than individual sharing. This has some clear downfalls, especially when political and medical misinformation is spread.</p>

<p>Groups are the primary construct in which people socialize in a mobile-first world, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until major platforms open up a bit more to allow for some innovation in these spaces.</p>

              The Rule of 40
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I was recently reminded of the Rule of 40 for growing SaaS businesses (coined by Brad Feld in <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2015/02/rule-40-healthy-saas-company.html">this blog post</a>), which states that the sum of a business growth rate and it‚Äôs profit margin should equal to approximately 40%.</p>

<p>So, if a business is growing at 20% (assuming YoY), it should generate 20% of profit. If you are growing at 100% assuming YoY, you can stand to <em>lose</em> 60% and still be considered ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. This is simply a benchmark but is a good one to resolve growth vs. profitability decisions. Growth rates can also be benchmarked based on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-saas-travel-adventure/">T2D3 framework</a>.</p>

<p>Growth and profit seldom grow in unison because companies do things that move one forward and strain the other, so having a simple to understand rule to maintain balance is very useful.</p>

              <p>‚ÄúIt is incredibly easy to lose focus‚Äù</p>

<p>A friend told me this yesterday; it resonated a lot. It made me think about focus through the lens of inversion. There are a lot of tools and frameworks avaialable for people to maintain focus. But, ‚Äúkeeping focus‚Äù is like a goal that you‚Äôre always fighting against. It sounds obvious, but anytime you <em>lose focus</em>, you‚Äôve lost in your battle to <em>keep it</em>. So it demotivates you, and makes you feel like distraction is a part of your identity versus something that you simply experience.</p>

<p>So, instead of trying to keep focus, just try to note when you‚Äôve lost it. And when you do, bring it back to whatever you were working on last. The ability to note your distraction and come back to the task at hand is like a muscle - it will become stronger over time.</p>

<p>Over time, you will also understand the <em>triggers</em> that lead to distractive patterns. The best way to keep focus is then to avoid those triggers - something that is more actionable than simply trying to ‚Äúkeep focus‚Äù.</p>

<p>I was in Seattle and it was the second day of an internship at Amazon.com. It was 2001 and I was working on the [tiny] mobile team. A friend generously lent me a space on their couch while I looked for an apartment, so I was sleeping on the couch when my friend woke me and turned on the TV. As the events were still unfolding, many major cities like Seattle were on high alert and were evacuating their skyscrapers. We actually went in to work, but then rushed back home. We were warned that being in a highrise wasn‚Äôt safe. It was a real and unforgettable fear. It was what I felt during scud missile attacks during the first Gulf War in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>It was also a time that brought people together. Strangers became family and friends, collectively supporting each other over the next few hours and days. I‚Äôm sure many of those bonds still last.</p>

<p>Humans are capable of infinite love and hate. In a strange way, both were on display that day.</p>

<p>The financial product landscape is monopolized by banks, which wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing if there was a greater range of  products available. There are so many segments of the population that have unique problems that are not being served by existing products. This is true especially in Canada which is a very multicultural society.</p>

<p>Taking a more customer centric approach to banking and looking at the unique needs of these segments - the elderly, immigrants, caregivers - are paramount to creating a better banking experience. Whether it‚Äôs loan products with friendlier terms, financing for those taking care of their parents, appealing to those that have a cultural inhibition to debt - all of these things are not being addressed through the current product suite across banks. They have taken a bank-centric vs. customer centric approach, and it shows.</p>

<p>This is a problem and a huge opportunity. Thankfully, this is a known problem and many fintech companies (the entire industry, arguably) are actively working on solutions.</p>

              <p>Companies are complex systems. We create abstractions to simplify working within them. For example,</p>

<p>‚ÄúStrategy‚Äù is an abstraction for the collective of short and long term decisions to win in a market. 
‚ÄúOperations‚Äù is an abstraction for the sum of working norms in place towards some enterprise output.</p>

<p>And then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù, probably the most misunderstood.</p>

<p>Culture is an abstraction for the sum of all interactions between people in an organization. Often articulated as a set of ‚ÄúValues‚Äù, this encompasses everything from everyday decision making to creating a sense of belonging and psychological safety. The broadest definition of culture is all-encompassing, and that‚Äôs perhaps why it‚Äôs interpreted in so many ways across companies.</p>

<p>Yesterday I read a really good blog post by Casey Winters, CPO at Eventbrite, who wrote about <a href="https://caseyaccidental.com/cultural-values/">cultural values</a>. In it, he describes how cultural values are better described on a <em>spectrum</em> rather than on their own. For example, on the spectrum of speed vs. quality, Facebook encourages it‚Äôs employees to bias towards speed.</p>

<p>So much of culture is reflected in decision making, which in itself is an exercise in evaluating trade-offs. Cultural values should be clear about those trade-offs.</p>

              Some Notes on Fintech
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Some thoughts about common growth and expansion vectors for Fintech startups.</p>

<p>The first direction is horizontal expansion to offer more financial products (e.g. insurances, mortgages, loans, etc). This is the most common approach. Investment service providers expand to offer different savings and investment products. A good example is Wealthfront - known for it‚Äôs investment platform, which also now offers bridge loans.</p>

<p>The second vector is verticalization, i.e. to own more of the customer experience upto the point of creating financial products. This applies to fintech‚Äôs that are mostly discovery / referral businesses. Verticalization means owning the application process and providing the financial product itself (i.e. a loan or insurance).</p>

<p>Both of the above approaches lead to a fintech turning into a neo-bank (a digital native financial service provider).</p>

<p>The third vector is geographic expansion. This approach requires an investment in regulatory compliance but is a relatively smaller investment than a bank establishing branches overseas. This is less common but there are some good examples of this - Wealthsimple in Canada operates in the US and UK.</p>

<p>All three examples have a common thread - take a digital first, customer driven approach to financial services and compete on <em>simplicity</em> to get the financial products.</p>

              <p>I live to travel. I love that tech has made it easy to experience the world, whether its through instant online booking, social recommendations or home-sharing.</p>

<p>While the convenience is great, I do miss parts of the travel agent experience. I miss the ability to contact someone that understands your travel preference, can find you things you might not have been looking for, and make the process of travel planning more fun than work.</p>

<p>What tech has done is taken a fragmented supply (flights, hotels, etc) and make it really easy for the customer to make the best choices at the cheapest cost. In similar ways to other marketplaces, those suppliers now depend on travel bookings by these sites and advertise good reviews.</p>

<p>However, I wonder if there‚Äôs a need for a product to help those travel agents become more successful, and to help people <em>become</em> travel agents. I have friends with amazing taste that refer people to travel destinations without participating in any upside for that referral. It would be really interesting to see a product that helps them participate in that; I think it‚Äôs worth it for all sides involved.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I made a small adjustment to my planning routine recently - to simply <em>do things in priority order</em>. This is a simple principle but incredible difficult to execute in practice. I‚Äôm sharing the method I use.</p>

<p>First, I start with writing my global priorities. For me this is - my physical and mental health, the well being of my family and friends, and then the things that give me professional and creative fulfillment. Within this structure, I put down the tasks that I need to do during the day.</p>

<p>So for my physical and mental health - this is working out, a short meditation and writing. 
For my family, these are the things to maintain and improve my most important personal relationships. 
For professional fulfillment, these are the things I do at work with a team trying to realize a collective vision.</p>

<p>Then I start working on them in order.</p>

<p>This means I start my day with a workout, meditation, and writing. Then, I do the family &amp; friends stuff - whether it‚Äôs ordering diapers on Amazon or getting back in touch with someone. And then I move on to work tasks, which I also <em>try</em> to prioritize.</p>

<p>This only applies to weekdays. Weekends follow a very different structure when you have kids. This isn‚Äôt perfect and I still get distracted (noting when that happens is also critical). But I really appreciate getting the most important things done first.</p>

              <p>Futureland is a supportive multidisciplinary community of people committed to creating something <em>everyday</em> for a year. It‚Äôs <a href="https://hfo.futureland.tv/">a new way to learn anything</a>, and recently launched <a href="https://internetvin.com/2019/09/06/futureland-support-packs/">Futureland Support Packs</a>.</p>

<p>Support Packs are a way to fund the development of the project, which is currently a solo-effort by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/internetvin">InternetVin</a>. He says it best in the <a href="https://internetvin.com/2019/09/06/futureland-support-packs/">blog post</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Futureland has demonstrated that it can be an effective tool for someone to learn new skills and stick to long term projects. I receive positive feedback on this project every day. But can Futureland continue to sustain itself? At this point, Futureland is entirely created and supported by me.</p>

  <p>I started to wonder, how Futureand could ask for support in a way that (1) was respectful of early user support through their time and energy. And (2) recognizes that Futureland is still very much a product in development and therefore should not be priced like a final product.</p>

  <p>The solution I came to was this concept of optional support for existing users. If users want and are in a position to support Futureland, they can. I created a few different methods to do that. Some are simple like a $20 pledge and others include cool products like a limited full-sleeve Futureland tee.</p>

  <p>I will always be experimenting with new ways to sustain and expand Futureland while being respectful to its earliest users. The vision is to create a tool that makes it a little easier for any one on Earth to learn anything.</p>

              Some Productivity Learnings
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I had a really great conversation today about managing time, and ended up going over some of my most important learnings about productivity over the last year. These are some of them.</p>

<p>Start with <a href="/20180902/self-curiosity.html">self curiosity</a>. Try to understand your daily energy levels (what time of day you are most productive), and design your day around that. That will be a quick win that will help you understand how to replicate productive times throughout the day. I started this by <a href="/20180918/time-tracking-update.html">logging my time</a> for an extended period to observe where it was being spent. Spend time to look back - I do <a href="/20180911/productivity-planning-retros.html">retrospectives</a> on a regular basis to find patterns and ways I can improve. When you find out time is being spent in a way, or a time you don‚Äôt want it to - try to take it back. It‚Äôs yours.</p>

<p>Improving <em>yourself</em> requires as much intention as improving <em>your work</em>. Remember that you and your work are two separate things. Externalizing yourself from your work allows you to stay calm. A good tool is to understand the emotional triggers that lead you into time-consuming thought patterns (stress, intense excitement). I do this with an anxiety journal where I write down ‚Äúwhat happened‚Äù and ‚Äúhow it made me feel‚Äù. The act of noting these triggers itself relieves stress.</p>

<p>By nature, this list will get better over time as I learn more about myself and what makes me productive and happy.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Marketplace Identity
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Marketplaces are a great place for consumers and producers to come together online. Across industries, dual-sided marketplaces have untapped latent demand or better utilized supply and created really interesting businesses along the way.</p>

<p>As marketplaces grow, consumers come to expect the benefits of economies of scale - better selection, price and overall fulfillment experience. As producers become more savvy, they will want to exercise more control over the entire customer experience. Ultimately, as entrepreneurs, most of them will want to own that customer relationship themselves.</p>

<p>This creates a choice that defines the identity the marketplace - to focus on building the largest end-customer base, or to focus on helping sellers become the most successful. There are of course examples where building for both can work for an extended period of time, but managing <a href="/20190710/maintaining-equilibrium-marketplace-development.html">equlibrium</a> is incredibly difficult as marketplaces scale.</p>

              Why Flywheels
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Cross-posted from <a href="https://flywheels.substack.com/p/why-flywheels">Flywheels</a>.</p>

<p>The funnel has been the dominant mental model to understand product performance for software startups. It was coined by Dave McClure of 500 Startups fame, and describes a customer journey through a product, from the channel they arrived to the point they start paying you.</p>

<p>For a lot of software, this experience encapsulated the user journey well enough, and funnels became the most common model to measure startup health.</p>

<p>They highlight some important measures of success. The proportions of users that make it through each step, especially over a time-series, can give us a really good understanding of how well a specific part of the business is doing.</p>

<p>The problem is that funnels are still an incomplete model. A funnel is simply one part of the flywheel,  and only operates in a single direction. We know how much things are happening, but don‚Äôt know why.</p>

<p>A more complete model for growing products is the <em>flywheel</em>.</p>

<p>A flywheel is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph#Directed_cycle_graph">cyclical graph</a>, where each node represents a key event or user action that drives the business forward. This makes them a more complete way of understanding how a business actually grows, by tying together the events that create continued usage.</p>

<p>The best products create flywheel effects where the effects of one event can cause that event to happen again. For example, a user joining a social network might interact with some content and share it to someone outside the network, causing someone new to join the network, and so on.</p>

<p>This is a simple example but in reality, the nuanced events that drive businesses forward are pretty fascinating.</p>

<p>In this newsletter I intend to explore fast growing businesses across industries, and also look at some already successful businesses retrospectively to examine how they grew through the lens of a flywheel.</p>

              On Immigration
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>There‚Äôs been some uproar online about the People‚Äôs Party billboards that popped up in Toronto recently, decrying mass immigration. It‚Äôs disgusting but not surprising; Canada is not immune to blatant state-sponsored racism.</p>

<p>My experience is the immigrant experience, but probably not the typical one. I‚Äôve gone through so many visas and statuses I‚Äôve lost count.</p>

<p>I came to Canada in 1997 on a diplomatic visa, and started school at the University of Waterloo. I transferred to a student visa, and also did a number of co-op terms in the United States (on a J1 training visa) at Amazon.com in Seattle. I had all intentions of moving to the US. But, the visa for my last co-op term wasn‚Äôt granted because the Embassy deemed I had spent ‚Äútoo many terms‚Äù in the US, and needed to go back to my country of citizenship (India) to apply my training for atleast two years. That wasn‚Äôt an option, so I stayed in Toronto.</p>

<p>It was 2003, and there weren‚Äôt too many tech companies around. I called and emailed over 250 companies in two weeks looking for a technical internship starting immediately. Only one company answered - Tira Wireless - and that‚Äôs where I worked for my last term and as my first full time job. At Tira, I moved from a work visa and started my application for permanent residence. I officially landed as an immigrant around 2009, and a citizen a few years later. In total, the nerve-wracking process took almost 10 years.</p>

<p>Immigration is a tense process, and every step is a small win towards the life you want to live. It also creates loyalties around those that helped you along the way. Tira is no longer around, but I‚Äôll always remember it as the company that supported and sponsored in this important transition in my life.</p>

It‚Äôs an interesting newsletter about the future of education and work, and this week they posted an overview of Income Sharing Agreements, or ISA‚Äôs. These have become very popular and apparently 40% of the current crop of YC companies use some form of ISAs.</p>

<p>ISA‚Äôs are a simple funding agreement that provides upfront education (or payment of education fees), in return for a share of future employment income. Lambda School is an ISA that pays for coding school and asks students for their first paycheck of the tech job they landed. They are a great way to align incentives between students and those providing training. One of the reasons they are being used now is because of the global skills gap, which is especially pronounced in the tech industry.</p>

              The Purpose of a Corporation
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Since 1997, a group of CEO‚Äôs of the biggest American corporations have been getting together in an annual  Business Roundtable summit. In their most recent summit, they issued a startement committing to a new purpose of a corporation (since 1997, this has been to serve shareholders, and to maximize shareholder value). The new mandate includes this, but also some other <a href="https://opportunity.businessroundtable.org/ourcommitment/">committments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Delivering value to our customers. We will further the tradition of American companies leading the way in meeting or exceeding customer expectations.</li>
    <li>Investing in our employees. This starts with compensating them fairly and providing important benefits. It also includes supporting them through training and education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing world. We foster diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect.</li>
    <li>Dealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers. We are dedicated to serving as good partners to the other companies, large and small, that help us meet our missions.</li>
    <li>Supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.</li>
    <li>Generating long-term value for shareholders, who provide the capital that allows companies to invest, grow and innovate. We are committed to transparency and effective engagement with shareholders.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Each of our stakeholders is essential. We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am immediately reminded of the <a href="/20181020/leadership-lattice-simplified.html">leadership lattice</a> - a mental model for <em>how companies work</em> and leader‚Äôs role within it. The lattice describes how leaders have to manage their attention towards individual growth, team productivity, the product of their effort, the extent of impact in their market, and the second order effects of that impact. This broader responsibility is reflected in this mandate as well with some level of committment from the CEO‚Äôs of these orgs. While it feels good to commit to this, it feels reactionary, a bit late, and I remain skeptical about it‚Äôs impact. I hope I‚Äôm wrong.</p>

              The WeWork IPO
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Ben Thompson from Stratechery makes the bull case for the WeWork IPO, and compares it to the AWS business. Which I think is an apt analogy. It‚Äôs a first principles approach - think about the largest item on a startup financial statement and rent is probably high up there. WeWork turns a fixed cost into a variable expense based on usage, allowing startups to allocate their capital to what matters more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is nothing more fixed than real estate, yet WeWork‚Äôs offering transforms real estate into a variable cost for all kinds of companies, with benefits that roughly mirror public clouds:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>New companies can have instant access to a well-appointed office space and pay for only a desk or two, and then grow as needed.
Growing companies do not need to spend time on extensive build-outs months or years ahead of future growth, and instead pay for more space as they need it.
Established companies no longer need to have a real estate competency all over the world, and can in fact expand to new territories with far less risk than previously required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really interesting take and could very well become true, but still a massive leap of faith. WeWork‚Äôs financial and operational red flags cannot be ignored. As Ben himself wrote, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/why-wework-isnt-aws-and-the-ceo-problem-cloudflares-s-1-contrasting-s-1s/">leadership matters</a>.</p>

              Marketplaces, Decentralization and Losing Trust (Part 2)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is the second in a series of posts about how decentralization takes place in marketplaces - through an erosion of trust in intermediaries. In my <a href="/20190818/marketplaces-decentralization-trust-supply-side.html">first post</a>, I examined how trust breaks down in suppliers and what that causes.</p>

<p>Customers losing trust happens when the marketplace no longer offers the level of convenience (through price or selection), or doesn‚Äôt invest in improving the fulfillment experience of a product or service sold in the marketplace. This is generally a slower process - one bad experience will not mean a customer writes off the marketplaces; but over time dissatisfaction can compound.</p>

<p>Additionally, supplier mistreatment creates a side effect of lost trust with customers. This is true especially in today‚Äôs ecosystem where customers are more discerning about the goods and services they consume.</p>

<p>The opportunity here is two sided. One is to provide customers with the same level of utility  when purchasing directly from multiple suppliers.  For example, discovery or managing your fulfillment  experience (e.g shipping tracking). If the friction or cost of switching is too high customers will likely stay with the central marketplace.</p>

<p>There is also opportunity in offering services that the central marketplace probably wouldn‚Äôt provide because it‚Äôs against their ethos or values, or goes against their core business model. For example, offering easy data portability is not in Facebooks interest. DuckDuckGo is a good example here but not ‚Äútechnically‚Äù a marketplace. Lyft is another one, in that their ethos is much more friendly and supportive to their drivers at a time when people are losing trust in Uber.</p>

<p>Customer trust is tricky. Gaining it takes time. Losing it starts slowly and then fast. It pays to be proactive about some issues. Centralized Marketplaces carry an additional burden that they have to manage both sides. Decentralized marketplaces become stronger as bad suppliers fail, and overall customer experience goes up. This makes them inherently antifragile.</p>

<p>(This is an evolving set of thoughts and will likely be updated over time).</p>

              Marketplaces, Decentralization and Losing Trust (Part 1)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Some disconnected thoughts about marketplaces, decentralization and trust:</p>

<p>The first wave of marketplaces has been about setting up intermediaries between suppliers and customers across different industries. Sometimes the supply has come from existing sources (e.g. Expedia for Hotels and Flights), and other times a marketplace distinguishes itself because of a unique form of supply (Airbnb, Uber). Customers obviously benefit from convenience and access to this supplier.</p>

<p>For suppliers, these intermediaries did well to establish a source of revenue that perhaps didn‚Äôt exist before - e.g. for drivers of UberX, hosts on Airbnb. In many cases, that has become a significant portion of personal income and there are countless stories of people leaving their day jobs. These folks are often makers, creators and entrepreneurs in their own right.</p>

<p>But as these intermediaries become more powerful, they often do things to drive marketplace value, (or sometimes, just in the name of customer centricity) that ends up harming these suppliers.</p>

<p>What I believe will end up happening is a new crop of companies that exist solely to help these entrepreneurs operate as independent entities. These companies will provide suppliers with what the marketplaces do - the ability to reach customers, manage the customer relationship, and ensure that their customers are being fulfilled. This is already well underway in retail (Shopify being the clear example here), but also in journalism (Substack), Food delivery (Dumpling), and others.</p>

<p>This is how I believe <em>decentralization</em> takes place - through a slow erosion trust in intermediaries that are acting to optimize the overall marketplace versus trying to make their suppliers successful.</p>

<p>In future posts, I‚Äôll explore how trust in the intermediary gets eroded on the customer end, and what opportunities that will create.</p>

              On Diversifying Well

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This has been a bonkers week for the stock <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=^DJI">market</a>. It‚Äôs timely to read an essay like the one Ray Dalio published recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/diversifying-well-most-important-thing-you-need-do-order-ray-dalio/?published=t">Diversifying Well Is the Most Important Thing You Need to Do in Order to Invest Well</a>.</p>

<p>The reason comes down to two principles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extreme moves in markets and economies are largely self-correcting, because when they happen, they set into motion adjustments that tend to reverse those extremes</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>People tend to extrapolate what they have gotten used to. As a result, after an extended period of a certain type of market and economic behavior (a paradigm), it is likely to be ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù or ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù to the markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Combining these two highlights why diversification is most important:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of those last two principles combined‚Äîand because policy makers tend to move to reverse extremes in the markets and economies‚Äîwe have big reversals and big paradigm shifts in markets and economies. It is also why having a well-diversified portfolio that is rebalanced to maintain that diversification has a much better expected return-risk ratio than any single investment.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Today, I received a message from a friend asking, ‚ÄúWhat have you learned from writing on your blog regularly?‚Äù</p>

<p>It was a great question that provoked a number of thoughts, and I decided to write out my replies as a blog post itself.</p>

<p>First, writing creates deeper comprehension. Learning and expressing a readable opinion is a great forcing function for understanding any topic.</p>

<p>Writing also teaches brevity and the art of getting to the point. Infact, writing is more often <em>removing</em> words.</p>

<p>Writing as a habit has taught me about myself - my default systems and common excuses. This is likely the byproduct of a the daily commitment.</p>

<p>Finally, writing has become an instrument to do work. It‚Äôs not exactly learning, but there‚Äôs a ton of value here. I often end meetings saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to write about this‚Äô, and that post has lasting value (and a nice reminder of our interaction).</p>

<p>What‚Äôs growing: AI, Blockchain, Fintech, Food and Beverage and Software (automating internal processes). 
What‚Äôs not: Advertising, Analytics, Big Data and Social Media.</p>

<p>This data is a <em>signal of investor confidence level</em> in each of these markets, which is correlated (and sometimes cuasal) to growth in the markets themselves. It‚Äôs important to understand this abstraction - especially since seed investing sometimes suffers from herd behaviour. For that reason, there‚Äôs probably an argument to discount the outliers, especially given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/16/decade-in-review-trends-in-seed-and-early-stage-funding/">rise in seed funds</a> over the last few years.</p>

              Risk in Startups
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been thinking about early stage startup risk especially in working on the presentations about minimum viable products. In that discussion, I‚Äôll be talking about how MVP‚Äôs are a framework for de-risking startup investments. In the early stages of a startup, the risk of getting to product market fit is the largest (but not only) reason why most startups fail.</p>

<p>I came across this article about startup risk authored by Kanyi Maqubela - <a href="https://kanyi.blog/2018/10/18/classical-risk-vs-quantum-risk/">classic risk vs. quantum risk</a> - and it summarizes the <em>weight</em> of product/market fit risk really well - essentially, the risk associated with P/M fit is so much higher than all other risks associated with activities in that stage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does that mean for company formation? What if risk, as a function of milestones, looked less like classical mechanics, where there can be continuous, curve-like de-risking in time? What if all of the activity that comes along with building a company does not in fact de-risk it? What if product market-fit is in fact the only discrete state in the early stage that de-risks a company?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, you can de-risk an early stage venture through in many different ways but only P/M fit matters. Simply put, if you haven‚Äôt built the right product for the right people <em>at the right time</em>, nothing else matters.</p>

              <p>Most startups fail because they built something no one wanted (I read that it was upto 42%, but obviously not scientific). So, the path to building something out of nothing is fraught with risk, something that those working in larger companies are less likely to make. However, their years of industry insight may be extremely valuable in de-risking any enterprise from Day 1.</p>

<p>Why not try to solve both these problems together, by building a service to accelerate the path of validation for those with great product ideas - in partnership with a trusted group of product experts.</p>

<p>It would be a turnkey service that offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy setup of an MVP - whether it‚Äôs a landing page for a new app or quick prototype of the product.</li>
  <li>Performance marketing to target the right consumer</li>
  <li>Reporting and analytics on how well the MVP did, with a recommendation for whether they want to continue.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is obviously great dealflow for pre-seed stage VC, so access to a VC network would be a easy add on.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>These are notes for a talk I‚Äôll be giving in a few weeks about Value Propositions.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a product person, but even I will admit that most of product building is actually <em>sales</em>. Building products for customers is more about selling than creating. And most of sales is about listening.</p>

<p>Listening is knowing you customer. It‚Äôs knowing what your customer wants and needs. Sometimes they will tell you that, but most often they won‚Äôt. Which is why matching that with a solution is so difficult.</p>

<p>The first arsenal in your sales toolkit is often just a value proposition. This can be as simple as a statement or visualization of your customer‚Äôs problem and your solution. Your value proposition is used anytime you are trying to sell yourself to a customer, investor, or anyone curious about your business.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="www.basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> has a great value proposition statement. <em>All growing businesses run into the same fundamental problems. Hair on fire, buried under email, stuff everywhere. The good news? <strong>Basecamp solves them</strong>.</em></p>

<p>The first part is about articulating your customer problem - what is their painpoint, or what they want to accomplish with your product or service. A great framework for this is Jobs to be Done, which asks ‚Äúwhat job is your customer hiring your product/service for?‚Äù</p>

<p>The second part flows from the first - it‚Äôs a simple expression your solution in a way that it solves that customer problem.</p>

<p>There are some interesting ways of breaking this whole process down into vitamins and painkillers, and filling out a <a href="https://isaacjeffries.com/blog/2018/2/27/how-to-fill-in-a-value-proposition-canvas">value proposition canvas</a>. All these are great techniques but the basics are pretty simple.</p>

He recently wrote a post entitle <a href="https://offthechain.substack.com/p/the-machines-will-run-the-financial">The Machines will Run the Financial World</a> about how all assets are being tokenized into currencies (many through blockchain but not all). This enables quicker transactions, T0 settlement times and a market that never closes. These efficiencies will change every asset class:</p>

              Minimum Viable Products
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôll be giving a talk at Ryerson for a product management prep course, covering topics like Minimum Viable Products and Defining a Value Proposition. This post is an outline of the narrative of the first talk about MVPs.</p>

<p>Building anything is an investment - of time and capital. Investments are probabilistic - which means there is risk involved and a chance that things will fail. Startups in particular have a high failure rate - and over 40% fail because they built something no one cared about - there was no market need. Humans hate risk - it‚Äôs scary, but most importantly - failure sucks.</p>

<p>This is where MVPs come in. Minimum viable products are a framework for derisking investments. MVP‚Äôs came from the Lean Startup Movement created by Eric Ries as a framework for launching new startups.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.‚Äù ‚Äî Eric Ries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An MVP is a way to test the water - a small investment that helps us justify the big investment. It‚Äôs a test, not necessarily the whole thing.</p>

<p>Most importantly an MVP has to  be <em>viable</em> and actually solve the original problem in some way. And that product can be anything - a landing page with a promise, a service provided, or something else.</p>

<p>MVP‚Äôs are about derisking, not eliminating all risk. Minimum viable products exist to help you test a hypothesis but you won‚Äôt know all the details until you actually launch. MVP‚Äôs can be applied to existing products too, not just new products. There are some examples of <a href="https://speckyboy.com/successful-minimum-viable-products/">successful MVP‚Äôs</a>.</p>

<p>Software is getting easier to create. Risk to start is getting lower and it‚Äôs easier than ever to create a fully functional MVP especially with new tools and the rise of the No Code Movement.</p>

<p>Some of the most successful companies in technology started as MVPs - I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what these students create!</p>

<p>On Gaming‚Äôs reliance on technology platforms:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This reliance has several interconnected consequences. First, gaming is more powerfully influenced by technology (and therefore technology change) than other categories. Put another way, business models and content flow more strongly from tech than to technology. Evidence of this is abundant; regardless of whether content or distribution is king, making games under the wrong technological premises will always come back to haunt you.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found it useful to change the internal narrative from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling anxious‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm experiencing anxiety‚Äù. This detaches the feeling from your character. You don‚Äôt associate yourself as being anxious but recognize once in a while it invades your thought process.</p>

Some notes from the article:</p>

<p>On the importance of learning in an organization:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Like a biological ecosystem, organizations are either growing or they‚Äôre dying. And organizations grow when their employees are learning. So if you want a high-growth organization, you need to create a learning ecosystem to support high-growth individuals ‚Äî to expose them to new and challenging opportunities before their roles become stale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On redeployments:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Companies need to see that a high-growth employee who loves to learn is a very valuable asset. Redeploying them on a new learning curve within the organization keeps their expertise in-house and allows them to share and build on it ‚Äî a potentially exponential gain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On other ways of promoting learning:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Job swapping is only one strategy to put employees on new learning curves, help break down silos, and maximize shared organizational learning. Ongoing training and educational opportunities, job sharing, mentoring and outreach programs are a few other examples. You can get creative in how you mix things up, move people around, and offer employees new opportunities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without sleep <strong>you can‚Äôt form or maintain the pathways in your brain that let you learn</strong> and create new memories, and it‚Äôs harder to concentrate and respond quickly.</p>

  <p>Sleep is important to a number of brain functions, including how nerve cells (neurons) communicate with each other.  In fact, your brain and body stay remarkably active while you sleep.  Recent findings suggest that sleep plays a housekeeping role that removes toxins in your brain that build up while you are awake.</p>

  <p>Everyone needs sleep, but its biological purpose remains a mystery. <strong>Sleep affects almost every type of tissue and system in the body ‚Äì from the brain, heart, and lungs to metabolism, immune function, mood, and disease resistance.</strong>  Research shows that a chronic lack of sleep, or getting poor quality sleep, increases the risk of disorders including high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This post is a set of disconnected thoughts about abstraction - arguably the most important mental model in software design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the computer science and software engineering domain, the abstraction principle is used to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and implementation of complex software systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The process of abstraction can also be referred to as modeling and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design. Models can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computer science commonly presents levels (or, less commonly, layers) of abstraction, wherein each level represents a different model of the same information and processes, but with varying amounts of detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve previously talked about how software is <em>modelling</em> the world (<em>eating it</em> sounds off - I get it, but still). When things move into the domain of software ‚Äì a domain of almost infinite flexibility - interesting new dynamics emerge that then alter the real world itself. A good example of this is how social media is changing some fundamental dynamics of the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù.</p>

<p>Abstraction removes complexity that allows for technology to become more accessible. This is particularly true in software development, where innovations in abstractions made development more approachable by those less technically inclined. Early web and mobile development abstracted the details of devices which invited more developers and creating the grounds for more innovation. Services like Glitch abstracted the complexity of building a full fledged web app with some intelligent defaults and easy to use interface. AWS, Heroku and Firebase continue to abstract infrastructure to the point where spinning up a web server is a few clicks of work. In all these examples, abstraction is what creates inclusivity and spurs innovation.</p>

              <p>Ray Dalio penned another really great post about major paradigm shifts - going through each major decade since the 1920‚Äôs and then making some calls for what is ahead. He ends with an advisory note to buy gold as a way to hedge the upcoming risk vs equity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people now believe the best ‚Äúrisky investments‚Äù will continue to be equity and equity-like investments, such as leveraged private equity, leveraged real estate, and venture capital, and this is especially true when central banks are reflating. As a result, the world is leveraged long, holding assets that have low real and nominal expected returns that are also providing historically low returns relative to cash returns (because of the enormous amount of money that has been pumped into the hands of investors by central banks and because of other economic forces that are making companies flush with cash). I think these are unlikely to be good real returning investments and that those that will most likely do best will be those that do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold. Additionally, for reasons I will explain in the near future, most investors are underweighted in such assets, meaning that if they just wanted to have a better balanced portfolio to reduce risk, they would have more of this sort of asset. For this reason, I believe that it would be both risk-reducing and return-enhancing to consider adding gold to one‚Äôs portfolio. I will soon send out an explanation of why I believe that gold is an effective portfolio diversifier.</p>

            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>We had a really great discussion today about <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Long-Tail-Future-Business-Selling/dp/1401309666">The Long Tail</a> at Wattpad‚Äôs monthly product book club.</p>

<p>The Long Tail argues that more value exists by aggregating all the small niches together than in the small group of hit products or content. By this theory Youtube ultimately has more lasting value than Netflix.</p>

<p>This sparked another discussion on the different ways technology companies can play a role in aggregating the long tail.</p>

<p>The first is driven by customer demand - in the case of content, this is driven by <em>what audiences want</em>. This approach focuses on audience desires for free access, amazing discovery experiences and opportunities to connect with each other. There‚Äôs a network effect which improves recommendations that‚Äôs created when other audience members join. In this approach, the supply side - creators - often do whatever it takes to conform to what audiences want.</p>

<p>The second is supply focused - to help every creator <em>become as successful as they can be</em>. This is where the customer is the creator and the product is a set of utilities to help them build audiences and make money from their craft. In this world, creators are empowered to find the channels that work for them vs. being beholden to any one single channel.</p>

<p>Both can yield massive amounts of enterprise value and can both help the Long Tail become successful, but are polar opposite in the type of businesses.</p>

              Building Learning Infrastructures at Startups
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Given the massive disparity between easy access to capital and difficult access to amazing talent, startups - especially those in seed/series A stage - are in a desparate situation. They are losing talent to better funded startups and more established players, and at the same time fighting towards finding product market fit. Their only advantage - access to more stock options - is also getting weaker.</p>

<p>To help startups stay competitive in the market, they need to offer something more. And I believe that comes in the form of an environment for fast paced learning. Ultimately, a startup is a learning machine, and an employee that enters a successful startup is guaranteed an opportunity to grow at a disproportionate rate than the market.</p>

<p>However, setting up an infrastructure for learning at any company takes a lot of time. Learning management is a mature industry and there are a <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/corporate-lms">lot of competitors</a>. And when a startup prioritizes learning, an LMS is often not the first solution. They do a few scattered things - setting a training budget, hiring coaches, using recommended vendors for workshops, and so on. None of these things are tracked with any meaningful ROI.</p>

<p>Additionally, most of these infrastrctures do not account for the needs of modern knowledge workers - social learning opportunities, content delivered in super engaging ways, and the opportunity to raise their personal profile.</p>

<p>There is a need in this market for a modern learning management system that turns every startup into a learning machine instantaneously - one that fosters learning communities, focuses on content optimised for comprehension (vs consumption).</p>

              On Context Switching and Calendars
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve written about my frustration with mobile calendar apps before. The most annoying part of dealing with calendars on a mobile device is context switching between communication apps (chat, email) and calendars (for availability). It‚Äôs an experience that could be solved by integrating communication features like chat directly within a calendar app itself. Every event would open to a chat message between attendees.</p>

<p>This would do a number of things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chat and email would be freed of the clutter of coordination messages. The back and forth to coordinate events is a huge reason events don‚Äôt happen at all. This friction is bad enough that it prevents real world social interaction.</li>
  <li>It would be easier to refer back to conversations and documents related to the event itself, and create a forum to review/rate event.</li>
  <li>It would give calendars a natural network effect - more people on this app would add value to everyone else on the platform in your social circle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Calendars are an inherently social product that we are all forced to play in single player mode - just because of lack of options. Hoping this changes soon and Google/Apple fixes this problem.</p>

              <p>Travel has always been a part of my personal narrative. I lived around the world up until high school - spending three years a piece in Denmark, Malawi, Saudi Arabia, India and The Philippines. In 1997 I finally settled in Toronto - the most multicultural city in the world.</p>

<p>Parenting takes you back to your own childhood, and I‚Äôve often thought how I would even come close to recreating this experience for our family. Relocation seems like such a momentous challenge of finding a new home, livelihood and social support system.</p>

<p>But, what if that process wasn‚Äôt so difficult? What if you could painlessly coordinate the entire process of finding a new home and job in a new country, and connect with like minded people to build a support system? This sounds like ultra fringe behaviour but we all have friends that have moved to a different country just to experience a different life for a few years. It could become more normal much the same way renting your house to strangers is on Airbnb, or getting into a strangers car on Lyft or Uber. I‚Äôd like to imagine a future in which this is possible.</p>

              <p>From <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/giant-batteries-and-cheap-solar-power-are-shoving-fossil-fuels-grid">Science Mag</a> on the progress of solar technology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This month, officials in Los Angeles, California, are expected to approve a deal that would make solar power cheaper than ever while also addressing its chief flaw: It works only when the sun shines. The deal calls for a huge solar farm backed up by one of the world‚Äôs largest batteries. It would provide 7% of the city‚Äôs electricity beginning in 2023 at a cost of 1.997 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for the solar power and 1.3 cents per kWh for the battery. That‚Äôs cheaper than any power generated with fossil fuel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the power of technology cost curves. Incremental improvements slowly drive down costs of new technology - often while incumbents write off new entrants as not being good/fast/cheap enough. Soon after better tech becomes <em>cheaper</em> than the alternative, change happens fast and incumbents get displaced.</p>

              Maintaining Equilibrium during Marketplace Development
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Some thoughts on how systems thinking can be applied to marketplace development in early stages:</p>

<p>A marketplace is a system, and building one from scratch requires a keen sense of equilibrium on all sides. If you have too much supply, your early suppliers will leave for lack of opportunity. If demand outstrips supply, you will be left with unhappy customers (first impressions are difficult to change, although not impossible).</p>

<p>Another important aspect is timing to make adjustments. In the early stage, you have to constantly tune and tweak your marketplace so that everyone is happy - quickly osscilating to resolve issues to help suppliers be successful and make customers happy.</p>

<p>This sounds obvious but every initiative (project, feature, task) should have direct impact on your current marketplace. Avoid building something that will only have <em>second order impact</em> without any meaningful changes to the <em>current market</em>. Ask yourself - if this was built tomorrow, would our marketplace immediately change? If the answer is no, reconsider the level of investment. We buy the luxury of time when things are more established.</p>

<p>There are ofcourse many ways of maintaining equilibrium early. The most sustainable is to onboard early users slowly so that maintaining equilibrium is never a huge issue. Making sure you have a good feedback channel is critical during this time too. The other approach is to ensure your ability to iterate on changes is rapid enough to address any rising issues.</p>

              Crypto Business Models and Libra
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Fred Wilson recently <a href="https://avc.com/2019/07/business-model-innovation/">wrote</a> about how Crypto‚Äôs promise is not just in the technical but the business model innovation that comes alongside it.</p>

<p>This reminded me of the world of gaming and virtual currencies. In-app purchases and subscriptions are often mapped to coins, passes, candy and other currencies that can be redeemed in an app. Once they have been translated into these virtual currencies, we can similarly innovate on different business models that might work best in a specific scenario. For example, we can use the subscription API to give users coins every month (instead of simple access), and then use those coins to purchase content or pay other users in an app.</p>

<p>This full capability (especially that to pay users with coins) isn‚Äôt yet possible with the In-app purchase API‚Äôs provided by Apple and Google. But ultimately, the behaviours that have a lot of traction will then get adopted into those platform API‚Äôs.</p>

<p>Thinking of Facebook - the world‚Äôs largest social network - as a game, the Libra cryptocurrency is their virtual good. Difference being that they‚Äôre not the only ones controlling it. It has value pegged to real currency, can be used to trade goods and services, and can be traded in for other currencies on different exchanges. More so, when another app uses Libra, it creates network effect for that currency and the utility value increases for users of Libra. Already, Uber, Ebay, Lyft, Spotify and others have joined. More mature games have multiple currencies running in parallel, much in the same way there are hundreds of possible cryptocurrencies to purchase.</p>

<p>Lot‚Äôs of hurdles still to cross, but it‚Äôs an incredibly interesting time.</p>

              <p>I don‚Äôt like to think of software as <em>eating</em> the world; rather just <em>modelling</em> it.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs modelling our personalities and relationships.
It‚Äôs modelling how we tell stories through words, music, and video and games. 
It‚Äôs modelling our money and how we interact with it.
It‚Äôs modelling how we trust and look for social proof.</p>

<p>We now wear our software, live, breathe and sleep in it. We can almost touch it.</p>

<p>But software is imperfect: the map is not the territory. Models often over simplify and leave out the niches and edge cases, often excluding people without intending. It‚Äôs the job of the designers and builders to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen.</p>

<p>A model is a simulation, and through that simulation we can create exponential outcomes. When those stay in the software space, they seem harmless. But when you reach a certain scale, that simulation can have unintended real-world effects.</p>

              <p>Learning happens in small increments - bits of knowledge that collectively stitch together to form mental models of understanding.

Mobile amplifies this - shorter attention spans come with being able to consume any content on the go - we fit those moments into the day.</p>

<p>This concept can be extended pretty far - potentially doing away with the concept of fixed courses altogether to a more fluid learning structure. Using Microlearning structures we can eventually unbundle a college degree - although more likely is that it will  helps for the construction of more specialized degrees.</p>

<p>Software for learning will continue to become more adaptive to how humans learn - and microlearning is a big part of that trend for educationalists tech.</p>

              On Learning Styles
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Had a really great conversation today about how learning styles greatly affect comprehension. This would indicate instructors should cater their courses to every individual. So if someone is a visual learner we should look for a way to visually represent our lessons to them. Except this isn‚Äôt always true and most importantly doesn‚Äôt always lead to better outcomes. I read a <a href="https://career.ucsf.edu/sites/career.ucsf.edu/files/Article%20UCSF%20SEJC%20January%202017.pdf">paper</a> on this topic which concludes the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theories of learning styles suggest that individuals think and learn best in different ways. These are not differences of ability but rather preferences for processing certain types of information or for processing information in certain types of way. If accurate, learning styles theories could have important implications for instruction because student achievement would be a product of the interaction of instruction and the student‚Äôs style. There is reason to think that people view learning styles theories as broadly accurate, but, in fact, scientific support for these theories is lacking. We suggest that educators‚Äô time and energy are better spent on other theories that might aid instruction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scientific American <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-with-learning-styles/">writes</a> something similar, that while people understand they have different learning styles, they don‚Äôt behave rationally in picking the right learning strategy. From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite knowing their own, self-reported learning preferences, nearly 70% of students failed to employ study techniques that supported those preferences. Most visual learners did not rely heavily on visual strategies (e.g., diagrams, graphics), nor did most reading/writing learners rely predominantly on reading strategies (e.g., review of notes or textbook), and so on. Given the prevailing belief that learning styles matter, and the fact many students blame poor academic performance on the lack of a match between their learning style and teachers‚Äô instructional methods, one might expect students to rely on techniques that support their personal learning preferences when working on their own.</p>

              <p>Mindmapping is the act of articulating a thought pattern onto paper (or screen). Great clarity emerges from visualizing how thoughts connect. It becomes a systems diagram for thought - showing how one thought triggers another in a chain reaction. When I feel stuck on a decision, it‚Äôs often because that chain reaction creates a cyclical pattern I keep traversing.</p>

<p>Decision mindmaps look like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclical graph</a>. Each node represents an Action or State, and each arrow represents a specific path of consequence (which then leads to another action or state).</p>

<p>In the case of decisions, a node would be something like ‚ÄúWork at Company X‚Äù or ‚ÄúShip Feature Y‚Äù. Connector arrows lead to other states. Obviously a state can also include emotional states like ‚Äòsatisfaction‚Äô, or ‚Äòregret‚Äô. This can both increase self awareness and decision-making quality.</p>

<p>Connecting them on paper gives me <em>control</em> - it removes me from the thought, gives me a guide to navigate it, which then results in a more sound decision. Charlie Munger‚Äôs <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/04/munger-two-step/">approach to decision making</a> is a two step process - first understand the forces at play, and then the psychological factors that might be leading you astray. A mindmap is a great way to understand both.s</p>

              On Systems, Hallucination &amp; Vision, and Making vs. Selling Art
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is easily a classic conversation. Brian Koppelman (of Rounders, Billions fame) sat down with Marc Andressen to talk about selling creativity, systems thinking, and so much more. So amazing. <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/03/12/hallucination-vision-scenius-networks-selling-using-making-art-brian-koppelman-marc-andreessen/">Read here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brian: But I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, how do you learn to ‚Äî Do you think one can learn to do both things? To be a creator, founder/creator, and the salesman of your own work? Like, how does one learn to do that?</p>

  <p>Marc: Yes. Well, so first of all‚Ä¶ put it this way ‚Äî this is, again, where I think systems thinking is actually helpful ‚Äî ao, actually, we have a lot of this, so we have a lot of sort of founders who are like classical engineers, and they‚Äôre sort of classical introverts and the idea of having to go, kind of, you know, sell is like anathema, like, the idea. You know, they‚Äôve got these kind of, I would say, misperceptions of the salesman as somebody who‚Äôs wearing a shiny suit &lt;Brian: Yes, perfect!&gt; selling somebody something that they don‚Äôt need.</p>

  <p>And so, we have a couple of responses to that. We have a specific response to that, which is actually the role of sales is (at least in our industry) is not to sell something you don‚Äôt need ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually to help somebody buy what they actually do need. And we can have a long conversation about that. The really good sales people in Silicon Valley who make a lot of money become very personally bonded to their customers; they end up going to their customers‚Äô, you know, weddings, to their kids‚Äô weddings ‚Äî like, they become like, very close allies to the careers of their customers. We can have a long conversation about that. It‚Äôs a real form of value-add to the customer.</p>

  <p>But even deeper than that. The thing I tell the engineers is, look, dealing with customers, it‚Äôs another systems problem. Like, you are the master of solving a systems problem, which is how to get the computer to do what you want. Like, people aren‚Äôt computers, they‚Äôre different, but there is a system for dealing people. You can engineer a system for dealing with people. And actually, when you work with top-end sales people, what you find is they have incredibly elaborate, like, very real systems. Like, very, very, very thought-through kind of abstract systems of how they basically run like, a large-scale sales campaign and how they deal with the customer.</p>

              On Risk
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been faced with some decisions recently that have tested my risk tolerance. Almost serendipitously I was catching up on The Knowledge Project, in particular <a href="https://fs.blog/howard-marks/">this episode</a> featuring Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital.</p>

<p>Some notes from this conversation:</p>

<p>On Outperformance: By definition this requires contrarian thinking. Getting ahead <em>by definition</em> means you‚Äôre working either smarter or harder than everyone else. Working harder isn‚Äôt en vogue these days. And while Nothing is really deterministic but ultimately working hard is a predictor of success more than it isn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>These two paragraphs from the <a href="https://fs.blog/howard-marks/">summary</a> really hit home.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be an out-performer, you have to think different from the crowd. But most of the time, the crowd is about as close to being right as you can get. Ergo, the problem. So, to be an above average investor, number one you have to think different from the crowd. But number two, you have to be right. So, second-level thinking is thinking which is different and better.</p>

  <p>The question is not, do you dare to be great? The question is, do you dare to be different? To diverge from the pack is required if you‚Äôre going to be a superior in anything. Number two, do you dare to be wrong? Number three, do you dare to look wrong? Because even things which are going to be right in the long run, maybe look wrong in the short run. So, you have to be willing to live with all those three things, different, wrong, and looking wrong, in order to be able to take the risk required and engage in the idiosyncratic behavior required for success.</p>

              Slack&#39;s IPO
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Slack IPO‚Äôd today and I was looking through the <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-19-004786/">S-1</a> they filed a few months prior.</p>

<p>Slack gets a lot of love from the tech press, and <a href="/20180923/slack-product-network-ecosystem.html">I‚Äôm a fan</a> of the product. I was taken aback at the scale of their loss and particularly the sales and marketing costs. Slack is upheld as the champion of bottoms up organic growth in the enterprise, but the numbers tell a slightly different story. Obviously an outsiders perspective but pretty interesting.</p>

<p>From the risks section of their S-1:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $146.9 million, $140.1 million, and $138.9 million in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Because the market for Slack, and the features, integrations, and capabilities we offer on Slack, is rapidly evolving and has not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations or the limits of our market opportunity. <strong>We expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, particularly in sales and marketing</strong>, expand our partnerships, operations, and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, continue to enhance Slack and develop and expand its features, integrations and capabilities, and expand and improve our application programming interfaces, or APIs.</p>

              Some Early Thoughts on Libra
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Libra is a massive new initiative to deliver on the promise of the ‚Äòinternet of money‚Äô using Blockchain technology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Libra‚Äôs mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simpler terms, from <a href="https://www.usv.com/blog/why-usv-is-joining-the-libra-association">USV</a>: Libra is a stable, fiat backed cryptocurrency that will launch inside some of the world‚Äôs largest consumer-facing applications.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a lot to take in with Libra but it‚Äôs pretty clear that the backing of the biggest consumer app in the world will jumpstart crypto adoption. The ability to send and receive money as quickly as we transfer data will unlock and create new opportunities. Being backed by a reserve gives it the necessary stability to build trust with developers.</p>

<p>At the same time, there‚Äôs a ton of challenge - trust itself being one. Facebook isn‚Äôt exactly known to be the most trusted organization but they are only a single member of the governing body. There are many questions around regulations. The government has already cracked down and asked Facebook to stop development on Libra, and the SEC has an investigation underway with Kik and it‚Äôs Kin cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing this evolve.</p>

              The Fifth Discipline

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The Fifth Discipline is one of my favorite leadership books. I‚Äôll be coordinating a discussion on the book tomorrow.</p>

<p>Some disconnected notes on the book:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A learning organization is committed to self betterment and adaptiveness to change. This makes it naturally resillient and likely to last longer.</li>
  <li>A shared vision is developed together. Magic happens when you can connect someone‚Äôs personal vision to one that the company needs. It creates a natural flow that is impossible to do if leadership is inflexible about the vision. People who do not share the same vision might not contribute as much to the organization.</li>
  <li>Systems thinking helps to connect everything together. I‚Äôve used this in the past in the development of the leadership lattice - a framework of how companies work that highlights how everything is connected to each other.</li>
  <li>Team Learning is a form of flow. When a team is focused on the same things and is consistently readjusting itself through instrospection and intelligent dialogue, it can create powerful business results.</li>
  <li>Personal mastery requires some level of introspection, but cannot be forced. It must be led by example and through creating environments of psychological safety.</li>

              The Score Takes Care of Itself
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Recently read <a href="http://www.sachinrekhi.com/bill-walsh-the-score-takes-care-of-itself">What Silicon Valley Can Learn From Bill Walsh‚Äôs The Score Takes Care of Itself</a>. Lots of great takeaways, for example this one on OKR‚Äôs and goalsetting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what Bill Walsh correctly points out is that the ultimate outcome metric that you are so focused on in your OKRs is not in-fact in your control. Many of the inputs to that outcome are in your control. But certainly not the outcome itself. And so what Bill is saying is that an over-fixation on that outcome metric actually doesn‚Äôt help you get there. You should instead focus on the part that you can control. And when you do this well, the score (the ultimate outcome metric you care about) takes care of itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This illustrates Bill Walsh‚Äôs style to focus on the inputs (what you can directly control) vs. outputs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you start to put these elements of Bill‚Äôs leadership style together, you start to see how it differs from the conventional wisdom. Bill encourages you to focus on the inputs and the process instead of the ultimate outcomes as the outcomes are not in your control. Bill expects leaders to be functional experts in the roles on their team in order to develop the Standard of Performance. These leaders are not just people managers. They are the very best at what they do. And they develop a powerful system, via the Standard of Performance and a passion for teaching, of inculcating their team to make them the very best at their roles. But unlike the benevolent dictator model, Bill certainly doesn‚Äôt encourage you to call all the shots yourself. But instead to build up the team and the team culture to be able to do so.</p>

              Five Lessons from History
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Pretty great <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/five-lessons-from-history/">post</a> from Morgan Housel on the <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/authors/morgan/">Collaborative Fund blog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important lessons from history are the takeaways that are so broad they can apply to other fields, other eras, and other people. That‚Äôs where lessons have leverage and are most likely to apply to your own life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some of the my takeaways and favorite snippets:</p>

<p>Lesson 1: Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>People suffering from sudden, unexpected hardship are likely to adopt views they previously thought unthinkable ‚Ä¶ Hard times make people do and think things they‚Äôd never imagine when things are calm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lesson 2: It takes a special kind of crazy.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Reversion to the mean occurs because people persuasive enough to make something grow don‚Äôt have the kind of personalities that allow them to stop before pushing too far ‚Ä¶ Being right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lesson 3: Things sometimes look like they‚Äôre getting better when they‚Äôre actually getting worse.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Unsustainable things can last longer than you anticipate. Identifying that something is unsustainable does not provide much information on when that thing will stop. This happens because of incentives and storytelling. Incentives are often tied to maintaining only one part of a system, not a whole system (see: ratings agencies, mortgage brokers during credit crisis). Storytelling because if enough people believe something is true, unsustainable ideas can gain durable life support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lesson 4: Progress happens too slowly for people to notice; setbacks happen too fast for people to ignore.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The irony is that growth ‚Äì if you can stick around ‚Äì is a more powerful force, because it compounds. But setbacks capture greater attention because they happen suddenly ‚Ä¶ Understanding the speed differences between growth and loss explains a lot of things, from why pessimism is seductive to why long-term thinking is so hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lesson 5: Wounds heal, scars last.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Those who survive calamities ‚Äì an important distinction ‚Äì have a remarkable ability to adapt and rebuild. It‚Äôs often far greater than you expect it to be at the end of the calamity. But there‚Äôs a big difference between a wound healing and a scar remaining.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can see and measure just about everything in the world except people‚Äôs moods, fears, hopes, grudges, goals, triggers, and expectations. That‚Äôs partly why history is such a continuous chain of baffling events, and always will be.</p>

              <p>Inversion applies well to the productivity problem. Instead of asking what to do to be more productive, look for what is making you unproductive, and solve those problems. In my case, it‚Äôs the amount and broad range of commitments not tied to my immediate goals.</p>

<p>So this week I‚Äôm forgoing my to-do list for a ‚Äúnot-to-do‚Äù list. A list of commitments to cancel, meetings I won‚Äôt attend, and conversations I no longer need to continue. Also - a reminder that I should <em>never</em> be committing to these things.</p>

<p>This is something I should be doing more often, but I have a backlog I need to clear. It‚Äôs time to free up time to focus on what‚Äôs most important and start saying no more.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A few unstructured notes on learning in startups today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Companies today have to accept a broader responsibility to develop their people in order to stay competitive in the market. This has always been true in a sense, but more pronounced in today‚Äôs hiring environment.</li>
  <li>Acquiring and retaining talent is the single most important issue for most startups. But, most HR teams are consumed the former (acquisition).</li>
  <li>The opportunity for continual growth is the most common reason why people join, stay or leave a company. Learning and development activities are an important pillar of this.</li>
  <li>Learning today goes beyond good content and how it‚Äôs delivered. It covers the full range of investment that a company is making in an individual. This includes - improving their personal brand, building effective networks, learning through peers, coaching and mentorship.</li>
  <li>Learning infrastructures take a long time to build, and as a startup there‚Äôs a gap in the market for a ‚Äòturnkey‚Äô learning management system.</li>
  <li>Employees are not empowered enough, and often feel alone in self betterment in a startup. They need active approaches, time and budget set aside, and feet in the right doors.</li>
  <li>Most if not all of the tech giants and larger tech companies have very strong infrastructures for continual learning. Many credit company success to those programs.</li>

              <p>It‚Äôs 11:50 pm. That gives me 10 minutes to write and publish a post that I haven‚Äôt even conceived yet.</p>

<p>But for some reason, I‚Äôm not worried.</p>

<p>10 minutes is also 600 seconds, a unit shift that adds a different perspective. Some funny math starts to happen - If the fastest person in the world can run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, in 600 seconds they can run 6000 meters. Obviously this isn‚Äôt true, but the perspective, however flawed, creates abundance from scarcity. This triggers a peace of mind and creates space for focus.</p>

<p>Mental tricks alone aren‚Äôt enough. A fast approaching deadline is another type of boundary in which creativity can flourish. A boundary that can be manufactured consistently by, well, procrastinating. This is a familiar place - I subconsciously wait for times like this to <em>force</em> creative output.</p>

<p>It would be amazing if I could maintain this pace of output throughout the day. But for now‚Ä¶time‚Äôs up.</p>

            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Game 3 was a resounding victory for the Raptors. The Warriors team just didn‚Äôt do enough to stop our offensive depth, and wasn‚Äôt able to find the offensive rhythm as a group to keep pace. Curry had a personal playoff record 47 points, but that isn‚Äôt important anymore.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm excited Toronto won, ofcourse. But I also can‚Äôt get over just <em>how</em> Golden State lost. This game really brought out the true colors of the fanbase. From Warriors Owner Mark Stevens pushing Lowry for no reason when he fell into the sidelines, to fans streaming out 3 minutes before the end of the game.</p>

<p>It just makes me appreciate how we support this Raptors team, and how our fans have become a critical part of the franchise.</p>

              <p>I recently learned about the concept of ‚Äúself driving money‚Äù. Money is one of our most personal assets, and the notion that we will one day leave all big financial decisions to software is really interesting. I think it makes a lot of sense, because so many bad financial decisions were the cause of carelessness, or lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://qz.com/1311135/credit-karma-ceo-ken-lin-says-autonomous-money-will-be-here-in-five-years/">QZ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lin thinks ‚Äúautonomous finance‚Äù could come about in the next five or so years. And eventually, all of our most important financial decisions could be automated without asking for permission. After all, do you know the best time to refinance your mortgage (and where to get it)? Your student loan? Your car loan? Me neither.</p>

              Some Disparate Thoughts on Product Management
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve had some great conversations recently about product management. This post is a collection of those [highly disparate] notes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On Shaping Products</strong>: Iconic products have a <em>shape</em>. Instagram, Twitter and Facebook are known for their unique takes on the feed. Tinder is about swiping. Messenger apps all have a very specific structure. Products shape around a core and adjacent user problem. To understand the shape your product should take, it‚Äôs critical to understand those problems and resulting customer funnel.</li>
  <li><strong>On Major Releases</strong>: Making large changes to a product in market is filled with anxiety and excitement. The former because large changes are necessary, but their success or failure is hard to pinpoint to one specific improvement. Many use this argument to focus on small incremental changes over time. I‚Äôm not dogmatic about either approach - but writing off one approach is a fools errand. There is a time and place for large releases. When it‚Äôs overapplied, it becomes an easy target. But without it, a startup can end up spinning wheels towards local maximums.</li>
  <li><strong>On Decision Confidence</strong>: Much has been written about decisionmaking frameworks. One I like to use often is the decision confidence rule - if you have 80% of information to make a decision, it‚Äôs time to make the call. Any more work will be diminishing returns. I find so many product managers scared to use their own earned instinct. This signals a lack of confidence in their own decisions.</li>
</ul>

              Strangely Breaking Habits
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>My writing habit is breaking down in a very strange way.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks I‚Äôve found myself fall into a familiar pattern - skip writing for a few days (or only write a few notes in a draft), and make up for it by writing 3-4 blog posts in one day. I‚Äôm not a fan of this intermittence, but also am happy that I‚Äôm keeping pace with a single blog post per day <em>on average</em>.</p>

<p>The day after writing 3 or 4 posts, I‚Äôm tapped out. So I take a break, and the cycle perpetuates.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure exactly how to reposition the habit so it can happen more regularly. Mornings are tough because those are my deep work sessions that I like to use. One way I‚Äôve seen it work is when I can complete a post right before I leave work.</p>

<p>Anyways, I‚Äôm not sure how this habit will regularize itself again - but one thing is clear - writing everyday at EOD isn‚Äôt working that well. I‚Äôm hoping to get this fixed soon.</p>

              Learning Systems in a Company
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This post is an unstructured set of notes.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve become interested in understanding how the best companies think about managing the learning infrastructures in their organizations.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How employees are given learning opportunities for personal growth</li>
  <li>How teams are provided the tools to continuously learn and get better</li>
  <li>How the feedback loops from markets help a team evolve a product</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is arguably just the domain of product management. For the first two - I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs an obvious market leader. Learning Management Systems aren‚Äôt new, but they seem like an overly heavy solution. Since learning is so individually driven, there feels like there‚Äôs space in a market for an LMS with a Slack-like distribution model - driven by employees but ultimately paid for by the company.</p>

              Diversity and Building Software
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I was having a conversation recently about diversity, which quickly turned into one about responsible technology.</p>

<p>There are two prevailing ways I think about this, and I wanted to clarify them in a post.</p>

<p>First - software is a strange beast. It has a disproportionate impact across the world than any other industry. The global impact of software requires that the teams building it are considerate to the needs of more types of cultures, races, genders, and other segments. It‚Äôs not <em>just</em> the right thing to do - it‚Äôs the smart and profitable thing to do.</p>

<p>Second - building a company, especially a software company - and ultra especially a successful one - requires you to take a broader look at your company‚Äôs role in society. You are building a system that empowers your employees to create massive impact. If that opportunity was only provided to a priveleged few, you are only building a system to perpetuate the problem.</p>

<p>These two perspectives have helped me understand the importance of diversity and inclusion especially for a technology startup today.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs very little else on my mind. But more than the game, it‚Äôs this question. Why <em>not</em> us?</p>

<p>Why not Toronto? Why not the Raptors? Why do we carry a collective impostor syndrome that tells us - we‚Äôre good, but not <em>good enough</em> for that ultimate title. It can feel undeserved; unattainable. It‚Äôs also bullshit.</p>

<p>Why not us? There‚Äôs no reason. It‚Äôs time to get our mental stigmas out of our own way - and show the world what we‚Äôre capable of. Let‚Äôs go, Raptors.</p>

              The Ivy Lee Method

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Today I learned of a simple productivity technique called the <a href="https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee">Ivy Lee method</a>, created in 2018 but still relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>At the end of each work day, write down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow. Do not write down more than six tasks.</li>
    <li>Prioritize those six items in order of their true importance.</li>
    <li>When you arrive tomorrow, concentrate only on the first task. Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the second task.</li>
    <li>Approach the rest of your list in the same fashion. At the end of the day, move any unfinished items to a new list of six tasks for the following day.</li>
    <li>Repeat this process every working day.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>There‚Äôs an app that makes this easier, appropriately named <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ivy-stress-free-to-do-lists/id1458049415?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Ivy</a>. I really appreciate the retrospective graphs. A few months ago I started using a simpler productivity system - weekly planning and retrospectives. For the latter, I look at what I accomplished vs. what I committed to. Retrospectives highlight my mistakes, which I try to avoid in my next round of planning.</p>

              <p>Today was the first day of Collision. There was so much happening on the floor, and it was really great to see Toronto as the centre of the Tech universe.</p>

<p>Here are some general themes I noticed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tech is dealing with Trust issues. More so, the lack thereof. Companies are operating in environments where trust is no longer implied but an earned currency. This came up in many contexts - discussions about social media companies and their role in distributing trusted news, or millennials relationship with traditional banks. Also amongst ourselves in the tech community- especially towards the central powers of FANG.</li>
  <li>Workforces on demand especially for engineering talent. Hiring is the biggest issue facing most startups and can be the main reason why many don‚Äôt get off the ground. There are a number of startups solving this problem especially for the early stage of shipping a V1.</li>
  <li>Technology and higher order problems. I‚Äôm biased because I‚Äôm also interested in this space. I saw a number of really interesting startups on the floor working on a range of solutions to psychological and social issues - everything from mental health to creating empathy through software.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was overwhelmed with the first day, perhaps because I was surprised at how much is happening. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what themes emerge in the next few days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.</li>
  <li>The series has received 47 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, and 2018.</li>
  <li>The first season averaged 9.3 million viewers per episode. By season 7 it was 32.8 million. Season 8 numbers aren‚Äôt out yet but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it touched 40M or more.</li>

<p>GoT was a cultural phenomenon by all measures. It‚Äôs the kind of story universe that can turn into books, TV shows, movies and amusement parks. The show might be done but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre done with these characters just yet.</p>

<p>Besides the specifics of the Facebook situation, I believe it comes down to a few broader factors.</p>

<p>Software is <em>different</em> than most technology. We need to recognize software has almost unlimited surface area - which explains how it‚Äôs ‚Äúeating the world‚Äù. Software, especially internet software, has almost infinite leverage. A piece of code written in a basement can produce real world outcomes across the globe.</p>

<p>Second, there are no real regulations on what is allowed vs not. It was hard to think of the potential of internet software, let alone how to prevent any bad actors.</p>

<p>Third, ‚Äòirresponsible‚Äô progress continues to be celebrated. Whether it‚Äôs blitzscaling, ignoring local laws, or simply moving fast and breaking things - the technology industry wears irresponsibility as a badge of honor. Without any regulation, decisions are made with a singular lens.</p>

<p>I think we‚Äôre only starting to see the downsides of not building software responsibly, and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a widely held solution yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Practicing intention with your time and considering when you‚Äôll fit in periods of focus is an important part of succeeding with a deep work habit.</p>

<p>The four elements of that are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Location</strong> - A space that‚Äôs conducive to deep work</li>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong> - A period of time that works for you (starting small then increasing over time as you build your ‚Äúdeep work muscle‚Äù)</li>
  <li><strong>Structure</strong> - The rules for the session - whether its digital distractions or how you will measure success</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements</strong> - What‚Äôs required to help create the environment - music, food, etc. This will be learned over time.</li>

              Finance for Immigrant Families
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Every society and culture has unique norms and behaviour when it comes to money. When an individual or family migrates to a different country, they bring those mental models with them. This can include, for example, different expectations around loan repayment or how money is pooled in an atomic family. All aspects of personal finance are affected - earning, borrowing, budgeting, saving, investing, etc.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this more pronounced than Canada - a country that is soon to be 50% immigrants in a few years. And yet, the financial products available to most Canadians are not geared  towards these unique needs.</p>

<p>This becomes extra complicated with newer generations that are raised in Canada but also have cultural and familial obligations to fulfill.</p>

<p>I think by considering the unique needs of immigrant families and cultures, financial service providers will benefit <em>everyone</em>. Sometimes it‚Äôs just a  knowledge asymmetry.</p>

<p>This is one of those areas where focusing on the minority improves the majority experience with a service.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Restricting talent to a local candidate pool isn‚Äôt a sustainable way to build a company. It‚Äôs impossible not to look outside a city especially in a competitive hiring environment like today. Remote-only organizations are becoming more common, and companies have to start building cultures where remote workers can thrive.</p>

<p>So what does it mean to do business in a global talent pool? Some considerations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hiring becomes both easier and more difficult. Finding the best people globally means there‚Äôs greater space for meritocracy vs privelege. But, finding the right person is now the proverbial needle in a haystack.</li>
  <li>Helping create team dynamics in a global talent pool is extremely difficult. This is a common challenge with remote work. Individuals can feel isolated and teams may not feel as cohesive.</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs an additional overhead investment to make remote successful. This can include operational issues like knowledge management.</li>
</ul>

<p>A global talent pool affects all parts of a company system - there‚Äôs great potential when it can work, but it won‚Äôt come without proactive investment. For many, that may be too tough a hurdle.</p>

              Negative Second Order Effects
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been thinking recently about second order effects. Specifically about planning for the success of a product or service. We spend a lot of time trying to avoid failure that we don‚Äôt think enough about the consequences of success.</p>

<p>These questions start with - what happens if a product becomes insanely successful. The predictable positive effects are cool, but not interesting. What is, though, is how might a product be <em>abused</em>? Knowing that something like this exists - what could a potential bad actor do?</p>

<p>Facebook is at the butt of these discussions now. Specifically for not being able to see (or worse yet act on) how bad actors can manipulate a global network. The newsfeed is the product which perpetuates all things good and bad on Facebook, and for many years was treated as the most effective way to harvest global attention.</p>

<p>So it deserves a pause sometimes to sit back and think of the negative effects of what you‚Äôre working on, and ask whether a vision is worth achieving at all.</p>

              Where User Research Lives

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p><a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-research.html">User research</a> is a critical to the design process. But, In an early stage software startup, designers and product managers often share the role. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve seen the role been split up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A UX designer will split their time in conducting research. Product plays a supporting role, often booking interviews and capturing insights. This can only happen when design has the capacity, AND there‚Äôs enough interest from one UX designer to play this role.</li>
  <li>Product does most of the research, because design is focused on the critical path of prototyping and building the product. Product steps in because there‚Äôs no capacity. This happens quite often, perhaps more so than the first case.</li>
  <li>Design does attitudinal research (understanding why people would use your product), and product focuses on behavioural research (how people use it - through A/B testing etc). This split can carry through for a long time, even when there are dedicated researchers on the team.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, what matters most is that you understand who your users are, the problems they‚Äôre having, and how well your solution is helping. The role abstractions are helpful, but every company answers these questions in a different way.</p>

              Communities and Investment

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I had a really interesting conversation recently about the dynamics of investor communities. This specifically was about individual investors vs. venture or other institutions, but some principles apply in both.</p>

<p>So the first question was - who are the participants? You would likely have a spectrum of people, ranging from bystanders (not investing, just here to listen) to investors of different types, to the communicators (ones sharing strategy). This isn‚Äôt dissimilar to content communities where you have consumers, participators and creators.</p>

<p>The second question is - what are the needs of each participant? For a bystander, a steady stream of content - information / conversation / editorial. For someone that‚Äôs investing - there are some utilitarian needs - the ability to manage and grow their portfolios. For those in a community sharing strategies, perhaps its the ability to participate in conversation.</p>

<p>Another major consideration is the privacy and security norms for an investment centric community. Investment and social proof go hand-in-hand, but people still need full agency over information sharing.</p>

<p>Robinhood, StockTwits, SeekingAlpha are all good examples of these types of communities - each catering to a different participant and need.</p>

              <p>I had a really good discussion today on the topic of products vs. programs, and wanted to put some thoughts down on this topic. Specifically, the difference between all three. In larger organizations it‚Äôs not uncommon to have a product, program and project manager working together, so clarifying the difference is important.</p>

<p>So what‚Äôs the difference?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Projects are defined units of work. They have a scope, schedule, and a cost. They are the simplest to understand of the three. Managing projects is the craft of coordinating humans towards completing a scope of work, within schedule and cost restrictions.</li>
  <li>Products are tangible entities - built to satisfy some market demand. They‚Äôre built and maintained most often by multidisciplinary teams like engineering, design and product management.</li>
  <li>Program management is pretty inconsistently used. They can be a group of projects which require coordination. In some companies program managers are synonymous with technical product managers (I don‚Äôt subscribe to this definition; I think it‚Äôs pretty silly). In my view, programs are the systems that drive a business forward. A program can be a product or product feature, and the supporting operations to make that feature successful. A product‚Äôs success does not always mean a program is successful.</li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôs all a bit abstract, and in my experience unique defined in every company.</p>

              Context Switching
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Following up from my <a href="/20190503/focus.html">last post</a> on focus, I wanted to write about the price we pay when switching context.</p>

<p>Context switching is a computing term, and often applies to the workload of handling many threads at a same time by an operating system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computing, a context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or of a thread, so that it can be restored and execution resumed from the same point later. This allows multiple processes to share a single CPU, and is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <em>human</em> terms, context switching is the process and time to moving from one task to another. This act requires shutting off your mind to the old task, and completing the attention switch to the new one. Let‚Äôs say you have <em>n</em> to-do‚Äôs in a day. With context switching considered - you actually have <em>n + (n-1)</em>, or <em>2n - 1</em> in total. So for 5 tasks, there are actually 9 with context switching considered. This is  pronounced if they are very disparate tasks.</p>

<p>Context switching quickly becomes expensive - it‚Äôs the invisible friction that‚Äôs brings productivity to a halt.</p>

              Focus
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Focus is perhaps the defining problem of the digital age. Access to more information has made ambition unbounded. At the same time, the same tools are designed to harvest <em>attention</em> - the raw ingredient that makes visions a reality.</p>

<p>This post is about some mental models I‚Äôve used that help to create focus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attention is Zero Sum. There are a finite number of hours we all have on the planet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre likely priveleged enough to have agency over that time. But spending time on one thing means you‚Äôre implicitly deciding not to spend it on another. That simple fact can prioritize the most important thing.</li>
  <li>Long Term thinking. It‚Äôs commonly said that it takes a decade to build anything great. If we take that long term view - when we look back it won‚Äôt really matter whether something gets done today, or a month from now. In ten years it will all seem like noise. This allows us to operate serially vs. in parallel and ensure we‚Äôre doing things in the right order of operations.</li>
  <li>Order of Operations - I‚Äôve written about <a href="/20181027/order-of-operations.html">this concept</a> before. It emphasizes that outcomes depend on the sequence in which you do things. You cannot combine the same elements in a different order and expect the same output. This is a fancy way of saying that strategy is about choices, all of which help to create focus.</li>
  <li>Serial vs Parallel execution - Serial execution is about doing one thing at a time, one after another. Parallel is about doing the same things all together. There is a time and place for each, but <em>serial execution</em> is literally synonymous with focus. Focus, by definition, is the choice of doing one thing at a time.</li>

<p>The first, Fred Wilson talked about his <a href="https://avc.com/2019/05/the-long-game/">long relationship</a> with Return Path and it‚Äôs founder Matt Blumberg. Very heartfelt and a really great story.</p>

<p>The second is an interesting project started by USV today called <a href="https://freelearners.org/">Free Learning</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Free learning is free-form and self-directed (much like Free Climbing or Free Diving). In free learning, learners ask questions, they want to know things. They use their innate curiosity to drive the learning.</p>

  <p>How does one free learn? The first step is to be passionate, the next step is to ask a question, and then the last step is to find a community where finding the answer is encouraged. This passion and community-driven learning is already happening in music and sports ‚Äì we join bands and teams that encourage us to learn more, and it is our own passion that drives us to get better ‚Äì imagine if the same could happen in other subjects too.</p>

              &#39;Wartime&#39;
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I hate when tech companies use <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/04/14/peacetime-ceowartime-ceo-2/">combat analogies</a>, but I‚Äôll write about that disdain another day. I want to talk about <em>wartime</em> - the most famous of them all.</p>

<p>Wartime is when companies go into <strong>must-win mode</strong>. Wartime is a mode of highly focused output, often driven by a market condition like direct competition. I‚Äôve been in a company in wartime mode, and recently had a conversation about that experience. This post is a collection of some notes on this topic.</p>

<p>In my experience, wartime was 3 weeks of focused effort towards a fairly ambitious task - launch a fully featured iOS, Android and Web app for a new product from scratch. It took working 7 days a week, and often 10-11 hour days. It wasn‚Äôt normal, and I really don‚Äôt recommend it for everyone - but we got the job done.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how things felt during that time, and some guidelines for anyone considering it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wartime feels unmistakebly different. It‚Äôs a hard shift that can‚Äôt be created through regular means. An aggressive goal in an OKR doesn‚Äôt create wartime. Companies can sometimes feel like they are in wartime mode until they see what that actually means. Wartime is <em>essential</em> when it happens, but it should never be overapplied.</li>
  <li>Know thy enemy - Understanding the scope of work is critical. You can‚Äôt go into this mode with too much ambiguity - people who‚Äôve signed up need to know exactly what they‚Äôll be working on from day 1.</li>
  <li>Wartime changes decision making. Things happen faster, and execution is more targeted. This means things will sometimes happen haphazardly, and we need to plan for that in the future.</li>
  <li>Wartime is a choice. The people working on a team during this mode have to be allowed to opt-out without retribution. It‚Äôs not for everyone, and that shouldn‚Äôt be a negative thing.</li>
  <li>Wartime gets the entire company together. In my experience it was a relatively small team, but the energy of the team spread across the company and beyond.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you or someone you know is in a company that‚Äôs planning to go into ‚Äúwartime mode‚Äù, I‚Äôd love to <a href="mailto:tarun.sachdeva@gmail.com">speak</a> to them about their experience.</p>

<p>Here in Canada the equivalent is BTSX - or ‚ÄúBeating the TSX‚Äù. It was introduced to me by a family member. He successfully used it over the last 2 decades and wrote about it in many finance publications in Canada.

<blockquote>
  <p>Most retail investors ‚Äì people like you and me ‚Äì pay fees to financial planners who invest their money in expensive actively managed mutual funds that ultimately underperform the market.

              Career Threads
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I was talking to someone yesterday about some of the common threads of our individual career stories. It was an interesting discussion and I thought I‚Äôd put it into writing. There are 3 themes that come up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Storytelling and Technology</strong> - I‚Äôve worked in the mobile industry since 2001, building products for entertainment and storytelling. Mostly in games, music and now written narratives (at Wattpad, where I‚Äôve been for the last 7 years). My most recent project, Tap, has been about unleashing the full potential of interactive storytelling. The smartphone is only 12 years old, and storytellers are just starting to realize it‚Äôs full potential to tell non-linear and mixed-media narratives. We want to be at the forefront of this and are building the ‚ÄúNetflix of Interactive Stories‚Äù.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Community, Technology and Responsibility</strong>: At Wattpad, we were very intentional about building not just a product, but a space to express and enjoy stories safely. Writers need to tell their story and find an audience without fear of retribution. Readers need a space to enjoy stories without fear of judgement. Wattpad, now a community with 70M monthly users, is still considered one of the safest spaces on the internet. These didn‚Äôt just happen - they came with years of effort across the company from privacy decisions to active community moderation. It all started with accepting that we have a broader responsibility of the full effects of our product - something leading social networks are just coming around to realize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technology and Understanding</strong>: Most of my career has been focused on helping consumers enjoy themselves with their phone. More broadly - it‚Äôs been at the intersection of software and entertainment. I‚Äôm very interested in how software can play a role in a higher order human function - to develop meaningful understanding. Maybe it‚Äôs too early to call it a thread of my career but it‚Äôs been top of mind for a while now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

              The Problem with Personality Assessments
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Personality assessments are well intentioned. They are supposed to help us understand ourselves and each other. Many of them are also grounded in scientific / psychological theory. There are a few I‚Äôve used that worked quite well - the Enneagram is one of my favorites.</p>

<p>But there is so much about the experience of taking these tests that gets in the way of their efficacy.</p>

<p>First, taking the test is a painful experience. As an individual, filling out surveys often over 50-100 questions takes a long time because of poorly designed user interfaces. It‚Äôs also difficult to measure or assess progress for a specific dimension of personal growth over time.</p>

<p>Those are just some issues for individuals. As a team, administering tests is fraught with similar usability issues.</p>

<p>Second, the data is in employers control vs the employees taking the test. Sometimes it‚Äôs as simple as tests being sent to old work email accounts - but other times a workplace administers a test and locks in data without any control from employees. For something as <em>personal</em> as a personality profile, this doesn‚Äôt seem right.</p>

<p>Third, your test is hard to share with others. Sure it‚Äôs easy to share a PDF with a slack channel - but most people don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing all of their weaknesses with others. How a personality test is shared - or specific results from a test - is a clear problem.</p>

<p>While personality tests are a great tool to understand ourselves and each other - these are real problems that get in the way of their full potential.</p>

<p><a href="https://svpg.com/coaching-tools-the-assessment/">The first article</a> focuses on assessing the strengths of a PM, and provides a great framework with 3 dimensions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This skills assessment is structured in the form of a gap analysis.  The purpose is to assess the product manager‚Äôs current level of competence along each of several necessary dimensions, and then compare that with the level of competence that‚Äôs required for this particular team and company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first skill is <strong>product knowledge</strong>, which includes knowledge of user and customer, product features, data, industry and domain, business and company.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Product knowledge really is table stakes.  A new product manager typically requires 2-3 months to ramp up to speed on product knowledge assuming she dives in aggressively and spends several hours per day learning.‚Äù</p>

  <p>New product managers are expected to know the basic techniques, but good product managers are always developing their skills and learning new and more advanced techniques.  Much like a good surgeon is constantly following the latest learnings on surgical skills and techniques, a strong product manager always has more to learn in terms of process and techniques.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third dimension is <strong>people skills and responsibilities</strong>, which includes team collaboration, stakeholder management, evangelism and leadership skills.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People skills are similar to product knowledge in that if you don‚Äôt have a solid foundation, it is very hard to do the PM job at all; yet as with process skills, strong product managers are constantly working to improve and develop their people skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this can seem like a complete assessment, it‚Äôs not a checklist. Most PM‚Äôs have a specific lean or strength. What‚Äôs not included here is an innate connection with the product - either because of personal interest or a burning need to solve a problem. Magic happens when you combine skill with determination.</p>

              Email and the Lindy Effect
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The Lindy effect is a theory that states the life expectancy of something like a business or idea is proportional to it‚Äôs current age. It was popularized recently by Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not ‚Äúaging‚Äù like persons, but ‚Äúaging‚Äù in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm not here to argue whether or not it‚Äôs true, but I think email is a great example of the Lindy effect. Email was invented in the 1960‚Äôs, making it over 50 years old. It‚Äôs not showing any signs of dying, infact quite the opposite. The distrust in centralized social networks and the second coming of newsletters support this assertion. Email is a fairly complex protocol but doesn‚Äôt try to be more than it needs to - a means of sending and receiving messages. This simplicity creates longevity and supports email as a ‚ÄúLindy‚Äù technology.</p>

<p>If email will be around for another 50 years - it would be interesting to see what that looks like in 2070.</p>

              Dimensions of Personal Growth
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Career growth comes in many forms, many of which aren‚Äôt obvious early in a career. It‚Äôs understandable to only see growth through the lens of a ladder - individual contributers becoming managers, then directors, and so on.</p>

<p>This is especially true in product management where I‚Äôve spent the majority of my career, but applies everywhere. In my experience I‚Äôve seen growth happen across a number of dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Growth through people management. This is the common, well trodden path. Individual contributers are often promoted into management positions where they lead teams of IC‚Äôs. This can work really well because IC‚Äôs have domain expertise - they know the work, so they should be able to manage a team doing that work. In terms of the lattice, you‚Äôre moving from the domain of direct output to that of individuals and teams. Where it falls apart is when individuals don‚Äôt realize that they have to exercise their leverage through people - and either over manage their work or under manage their output.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growth through increased scope of responsibility. This is often accompanied by the first, but sometimes an IC can get promoted into a senior level position with a bigger playground. They have demonstrated their ability to make change and are given a bigger playground. This is best suited for folks that don‚Äôt have an interest in people management, or those that want to stay close to the work but still see professional growth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growth through new challenges. Professional growth is accompanied by a certain amount of discomfort in the work. Often, putting people in an entirely new line of work outside their expertise creates growth. People have to want to grow in that new area (true for everything here), but especially so in this type of transition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growth through operational responsibility. This is a specific type of the above, but worth calling out. IC‚Äôs that are particularly process oriented can become a service layer to the rest of the team. It can sometimes create a new role altogether, and it‚Äôs a transition I‚Äôve seen a few times.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, going from individual contributor to any of the above options doesn‚Äôt restrict anyones path. It‚Äôs important for managers to find <em>how</em> their team wants to grow and create a path that‚Äôs appropriate for the individual.</p>

              Testing the Lattice: Trillion Dollar Coach
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I just picked up <a href="https://www.trilliondollarcoach.com/">Trillion Dollar Coach</a>, the story of Bill Campbell - coach to some of the Valley‚Äôs best. From what I‚Äôve read already, there‚Äôs a lot of insight around people and teams. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how this fits or breaks the Leadership Lattice.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a short intro to the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bill Campbell helped to build some of Silicon Valley‚Äôs greatest companies ‚Äì including Google, Apple, and Intuit ‚Äì and to create over a trillion dollars in market value. A former college football player and coach, Bill mentored visionaries such as Steve Jobs, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt and coached dozens of leaders on both coasts. When he passed away in 2016, ‚Äúthe Coach‚Äù left behind a legacy of growing companies and successful people, and an abundance of respect, friendship, and love.</p>

  <p>From their vantage points at Google, Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, and Alan Eagle experienced firsthand how Bill developed trusting relationships, fostered personal growth, infused courage, emphasized operational excellence, and identified simmering tensions that inevitably arise in fast-moving environments. To honor their mentor and inspire and teach future generations, they have codified his wisdom in this essential guide.</p>

  <p>Based on interviews with more than eighty people who knew and loved Bill Campbell, Trillion Dollar Coach explains the Coach‚Äôs principles and illustrates them with stories from the great companies and people with whom he worked and played. The result is a blueprint for forward-thinking business leaders and managers that will help them create higher-performing and faster-moving teams and companies.</p>

              The Versatility of the &#39;Company System&#39; Framework
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve referred to the Company System, or Leadership Lattice framework in a number of contexts recently, and what I‚Äôve found to be true is that it‚Äôs truly versatile in it‚Äôs uses.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As a model for company building - The company system is a first principles breakdown of a company and how it works. It starts with individuals, being organized into teams of all sizes, responsible for products and services that are adopted by a market of customers. The result of this has a broader impact, often encompassed as a mission or vision. There is also the leader themself, and the broader governance layer that is responsible for the whole operation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a learning framework - Leadership is one of the most written about topics, and social media has created advice overload. The system is a way of mentally categorizing insight and techniques - for better recall and to avoid recency bias.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a time management framework - So much of leadership is <a href="/20190209/leadership-attention.html">managing attention</a> on the right things, and this system provides a finite view of the different buckets of attention. Also, every company needs to focus on different parts of this system at every stage (e.g. early stage companies only care about how their product is being received, because it‚Äôs the only thing that matters at that stage).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a leadership type assessment - The lattice is a way of understanding different management styles. I wrote about this in an <a href="/20190412/management-styles.html">earlier post</a> - Focus on a specific part of a company system can define management styles. In essence, understanding where someone spends their attention can come to define their management style. Interest in a specific area is ofcourse a leading indicator to attention.</p>

              Context Collapse
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Context collapse is <strong>the process of disparate audiences being conjoined into one</strong>. It was coined by Dana Boyd in her book ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Complicated‚Äù, which detailed the lives of social media with teens. It‚Äôs an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300166311/apophenia-20">excellent book</a>.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this again recently, and dug into it‚Äôs origins. I came across Dana Boyd‚Äôs dissertation <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/TakenOutOfContext.pdf">‚ÄúTaken Out of Context‚Äù</a> on the topic. From the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My analysis centers on how social network sites can be understood as networked
publics which are simultaneously (1) the space constructed through networked 
technologies and (2) the imagined community that emerges as a result of the
intersection of people, technology, and practice. Networked publics support many of
the same practices as unmediated publics, but their structural differences often
inflect practices in unique ways. Four properties‚Äîpersistence, searchability,
replicability, and scalability‚Äîand three dynamics‚Äîinvisible audiences, collapsed
contexts, and the blurring of public and private‚Äîare examined and woven
throughout the discussion.</p>

  <p>While teenagers primarily leverage social network sites to engage in common
practices, the properties of these sites configured their practices and teens were
forced to contend with the resultant dynamics. Often, in doing so, they reworked
the technology for their purposes. As teenagers learned to navigate social network
sites, they developed potent strategies for managing the complexities of and social
awkwardness incurred by these sites. Their strategies reveal how new forms of social
media are incorporated into everyday life, complicating some practices and
reinforcing others. New technologies reshape public life, but teens‚Äô engagement also
reconfigures the technology itself.</p>

              <p>It‚Äôs Saturday night, and for the last few weeks I‚Äôve been struggling with writing - especially on the weekend, when full time parenting is the most draining.</p>

<p>But, sometimes all it takes is the simple act of opening my laptop and firing up a text editor to overcome the struggle. James Clear talked about this in Atomic Habits in a related section about setting up your environment for desired behaviours. For example, if you want to read everyday at night, when you make up your bed in the morning - place a book or e-reader on your pillow. That simple act of picking up a book can be enough to maintain the habit.</p>

<p>So this post is a reminder that all it takes is a little bit of effort everyday, and that trigger can start compounding very quickly.</p>

<p>You can make a decent guacamole just by cutting all the veggies and mashing it all together. The key here is order of operations - it‚Äôs the difference between good and great. I‚Äôve won a few backyard cooking contests purely with this side.</p>

<p>Summer‚Äôs almost here, so enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>3 medium sized ripening avocados</li>
  <li>3 fresh Roma Tomatoes, unrefrigerated</li>
  <li>1 handful of fresh cilantro leaves picked off the stem</li>
  <li>1 medium sized red onion</li>
  <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
  <li>Caribbean scotch bonnet hot sauce</li>
  <li>2 limes</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Chop up avocados, mash lightly in a large bowl. Squeeze limes into the mixture and add ¬Ω Tsp salt. Let this marinade while you chop the vegetables, for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Take the core out of the Roma tomatoes. Chop up tomatoes, onions into small cubes ¬Ω inch cubes. Chop up cilantro into small pieces. Mash 2 cloves of garlic.</li>
  <li>Fully mash the avocados, and then mix in the tomatoes, onions, garlic and cilantro with a spoon.</li>
  <li>Taste and add more salt, lime juice and hot sauce based on personal preferences.</li>
  <li>Eat immediately or after refrigerating for 30 minutes.</li>

              <p>There is a lot of conversation about giving both control and value of data back to users - mostly prompted by revelations of data abuse in social networks. This post is an exploration of some user experience principles that could become standard practice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freedom to Access - All personal data is accessible via an API</li>
  <li>Freedom to Transfer - All data can be verifiably transferred off any service. If I want my information to be gone from a social network, I should be able to do this easily.</li>
  <li>Freedom to become anonymous - Related to above - Users should be able to instruct AI models to be reconstructed <em>without</em> their data. This is a very complex</li>
  <li>Trust in Data Formatting - All data is preserved or converted into a format that is easy to use / move around. Proprietary storage formats can become a form of data hijacking.</li>
  <li>Compliance - Whether its HIPAA or GDPR, compliance will become a more important factor for users trying new services.</li>
  <li>Anonyminity + Privacy - The ability to stay (or become) anonymous should a user choose. I think we‚Äôre moving towards a world where privacy is going to become a central topic and factor in the buying / using decision.</li>
  <li>Transparency - It will have to be clear how data is being used - in what way, and how value is being derived from it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a much larger topic and these are only some principles. As with most things - my hypothesis is these will be adopted by a popular product. This will then make it a standard across all new products.</p>

              <p>I recently received the book of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Mental-Models-Thinking-Concepts-ebook/dp/B07P79P8ST">Great Mental Models</a>. One of the chapters is about thought experiments. From <a href="https://fs.blog/2017/06/thought-experiment-how-einstein-solved-difficult-problems/">Farnam</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A thought experiment is a means of exploring a concept, hypothesis or idea through extensive thought. When finding empirical evidence is impossible, we turn to thought experiments to unspool complex concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One specific thought experiment was particularly worthwhile - the total effect of climate change on the global economy. Below are some very incomplete notes from that experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Climate change is happening, and it‚Äôs effects are being felt in events globally, but it‚Äôs impossible to measure the total effect it might have. Also, some of the events that have occurred may have occurred whether or not we had a climate crisis. If the economy is really the sum total of all our commercial interactions - that might be a good proxy. The type of weather events (floods, fires, etc) are so wide ranging that it‚Äôs clear climate change will affect everyone but to the degree that it will change their economic behaviour is not. For the sake of this experiment, limit to coastal towns because that‚Äôs likely where the rise in sea levels will have the most drastic effect. There are a <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/cities-vulnerable-sea-level-rise-2610208792.html">striking</a> number of cities that are vulnerable, so it‚Äôs clear the effect will be drastic. Especially with cities like London and Shanghai - whose economic output is incredible. I‚Äôm estimating in the 100‚Äôs of billions of dollars, but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it surpasses 1-1.5 trillion.</p>

              Buying Time

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I said in conversation recently that <strong>‚Äúeverything in business is about buying time‚Äù</strong>. I wanted to expand on that thought.</p>

<p>A business itself is often funded by investors that allow it to make mistakes in the pursuit of a higher purpose. It borrows time in the form of capital that it uses to make micro-investments of it‚Äôs own. Some, when those investments really pay off, they give the ability to buy a lot of time. Those are often called ‚Äúmoats‚Äù but unlike moats they are not permanent. Almost everything in business is constantly changing.</p>

<p>Within a company‚Äôs leadership, discussions often circle around resources - what, how many, and where they should be allocated. When we pitch for resources for a project, we‚Äôre asking to borrow a set of resources for a specific period of time. We are buying time.</p>

<p>This concept extends down to every team and ultimately every individual action. When an individual or team succeeds, they are given the ability to borrow more time. Success begets success, which really just means you‚Äôve bought enough time until the next time you need to. This simplifies the intricacies of a human enterprise, but it‚Äôs a helpful mental model nonetheless.</p>

              Management Styles and The Leadership Lattice

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve had a number of conversations about the leadership lattice, and of building startups as a system of impact.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm increasingly convinced of the lattice as a means to represent the company system, a way to effectively learn about management and leadership, and also as a way of categorizing leadership styles.</p>

<p>The company system starts with individuals, being organized into teams of all sizes, creating products and services that are adopted by customers. The result of this has a broader impact, often encompassed as a mission or vision.</p>

<p>Focus on a specific part of a company system can define management styles. In essence, understanding where someone spends their attention can come to define their management style. Interest in a specific area is ofcourse a leading indicator to attention. These may change over time but understanding the mental model can help us understand the behaviour.</p>

<p>For example - a ‚Äúpeople focused‚Äù manager is one who spends most of her time on the individual (and perhaps the team). Results focused managers spend more time on how products and services are built and adopted - and potentially sacrificing the concern for individuals / teams.</p>

<p>This post is really a way to highlight the versatility of the leadership lattice / system of impact mental model. And now, it‚Äôs also a way to understand leadership styles.</p>

  <li>The rise of remote teams and infrastructure to support them (videoconferencing, Slack, etc) helps to connect one individual to the right talent, no matter where they might be in the world.</li>
  <li>Machine learning allows efforts to be compounded. By eliminating deterministic logic from common user experiences (user feeds, searches), they allow user data to create the ideal experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an exciting time, but worth a thought exercise of how far this can go, and how far it <em>should</em> go. I‚Äôm certain there‚Äôs a breaking point to infinte leverage, but I‚Äôm not clear where that is yet.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In online networks designed for sharing content, a general product trend is user interaction always gets <em>closer</em> to the content. Put another way, when users are given the ability to react to something <em>as they are enjoying it</em>, it tends to create more engagement.</p>

<p>Soundcloud‚Äôs <em>in-song comments</em> let you add comments to a specific place in a song. It‚Äôs arguably the most unique part of the platform, and often provides quality signals to listeners.</p>

<p>Reading platforms like Wattpad or Medium provide <em>inline comments</em> that let you comment and highlight what you‚Äôre reading.</p>

<p>Youtube lets you add a comment on a specific place in a video (but doesn‚Äôt highlight these to the viewer, so they are not easy to discover). Periscope and Instagram Live let you add reactions in real time in a very playful floating emoji/hearts experience.</p>

<p>Likes or favorites are often considered ‚Äútable stakes‚Äù for any content community. But when you let audiences leave their mark on their favorite places (in a song, story or whatever), it creates meaningful connection with content - and it‚Äôs creator.</p>

              Startups as Systems of Impact
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Last year I started to explore a new system of learning about leadership that I called the Leadership Lattice. Over time, my thinking on this has evolved. I think the Lattice is not just a model for learning leadership, but for building companies itself. It‚Äôs a structure that describes how a company works as a system.</p>

<p>In essence, a startup is a <em>system of impact</em>. A system designed to translate an individiual human‚Äôs effort into the maximum possible impact.</p>

<p>As a leader in a startup, my view is that we have the privelege that every person on our team has chosen to spend part of their career journey with us. Our job is to turn that time spent into the maximum impact that the individual desires. Impact can be on their own growth, on their teams, or the market where the business operates.</p>

<p>As leaders our responsibility is to manage that path. To own the entire system of impact. It starts with the individual, their teams, their individual and collective output, how that is receieved in market, and the broader impact of that effort.</p>

<p>Leaders, and founders especially, should think of their startup as a system of  personal impact. In the early days, the focus is entirely on the products and how they are received. But as the company grows and the right people are managing the right roles - leadership‚Äôs role evolves to building this system of impact.</p>

              A Framework for Structuring Community Products
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Having built community products for the better part of my career, I‚Äôve seen some common patterns in their structure. I wanted to document a common mental model I‚Äôve used to structure a digital community product.</p>

<p>The components of a community product will often include: user Identity (who I am), user Discovery (who are others, and where are they), user Connection (how can I establish a relationship with others) and user Interaction (how can I interact with others).</p>

<ul>
  <li>User Identity is typically shown with a profile (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) but you can be a social product with little emphasis on amplifying users identity (e.g Reddit or Quora‚Äôs user profile is very sparse).</li>
  <li>User Discovery is about finding others. This happens all around the product - search, follower lists, who liked this song etc.</li>
  <li>User Connection is about connecting with people inside the network, and then also bringing people into the network. It‚Äôs the first step to establishing an intentional, direct relationship with another user. Some products don‚Äôt need this (e.g. Reddit, which focuses on user relationships with subreddits as a membership model).</li>
  <li>User Interaction is what happens after the relationship is established. It‚Äôs about doing something with users you connected with.</li>
</ul>

<p>A digital community product doesn‚Äôt need all four in equal measure, but I‚Äôve seen most successful social products have some dimension of each of these.</p>

              Defining the Problem
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The smartest people know how to take something extremely complex and explain it simply. Most do the opposite, adding complexity into simple concepts.</p>

<p>This is especially true when defining a business problem.</p>

<p>Some of the most valuable businesses have originated from a succint definition of user problems. Instagram is a good example. It started off by trying to solve 3 key issues with mobile photos - they had crappy quality (therefore filters), were hard to share (therefore feed), and took a long time to share (therefore size limitations). Those three key features - filters, a fixed photo size, and feed - were critical to Instagram‚Äôs success. The funny thing is the originating problems no longer exist to the same degree, and those features are no longer the only critical part of the Instagram experience.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs useful to take a customer focused lens. Knowing your customer is a great compass. It‚Äôs also useful to start with a painpoint versus an aspiration. Negativity creates more action; people are more likely to adopt products that solve real problems they can relate to.</p>

<p>A well defined user problem can bring a team together. When everyone carries the same mental model for who the user is and what their needs are, alignment follows closely. It‚Äôs also a great way to encourage innovation across an organization.</p>

<p>Before building something no one wants, spend time simplifying the problem. It will pay off in the long run.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the lazy afternoons by the pool. Or the rum cocktails. Or maybe it was just months of taking care of twins. We were tired.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I like to see product discovery as a risk reduction exercise. One of the highest is the risk of building something that no one wants - which is why that risk should be reduced earliest.</p>

<p>SVPG has a <a href="https://svpg.com/planning-product-discovery/">great article</a> about planning discovery with a section about the often overlooked risks. This list can be filled with examples of companies that failed because they overlooked this risk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We must also consider value risk ‚Äì do the customers actually want this particular problem solved, or is our proposed solution good enough to get people to switch from what they have now?</p>

  <p>And then there‚Äôs the often messy stakeholder risk where we have to make sure that the solution we come up with in discovery actually works for the different parts of the company.  Here are some common examples of that:
‚Äì Financial risk ‚Äì can we afford this solution?
‚Äì Business development risk ‚Äì does this solution work for our partners?
‚Äì Marketing risk ‚Äì is this solution consistent with our brand?
‚Äì Sales risk ‚Äì is this solution compatible with our go to market strategy?
‚Äì Legal risk ‚Äì is this solution something we can legally actually do?
‚Äì Ethical risk ‚Äì is this solution something we should do?</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot recently about how software can be used to promote human understanding in the workplace. I‚Äôve written about this before, but will continue to explore this topic to clarify my thoughts. First in the problem space, and then the solution space.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, we need to prove that promoting greater understanding actually works. We know about research has proven greater understanding amongst team members accelerates productivity, but this most likely doesn‚Äôt apply universally. How important is it for teams to undertand each other better?</li>
  <li>Second, we need to prove that people care enough to make this product a part of their lives. Essentially - that it solves a real problem. This is the most difficult part of the equation, because my hypothesis is that most people consider this an esoteric problem that can‚Äôt be solved by software.</li>
  <li>Finally, we can start exploring the solution space to understand what shape this software might take. It could be a social network or a SaaS app. Individuals need to have full agency over the data provided and used by this network. There are a ton of opportunities and adjacent products that can be realized here too.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is available today to enable greater understanding isn‚Äôt sufficient. Personality assessments are seen once and not used on a continual basis. I‚Äôm going to keep exploring this space to see if there‚Äôs something more to be discovered here.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I had a really good conversation today about how we take ourselves so seriously, and how it creates unnecessary anxiety.</p>

<p>This happens when we try to become the most productive version of ourselves - and get disappointed when we have an off day.</p>

<p>This happens when we try to optimize for velocity in our work - and consider the status quo as failure.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also important to note that our goals are self imposed. Most progress happens over  time. A bump in the road becomes easier to manage when seen on a broader time horizon. It‚Äôs a good time to remind yourself - we often over estimate what we can do in a short time horizon, but under estimate what is possible in a longer one.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Analytics for a startup pre-Product market fit are uniquely different.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs really important not to over measure at this stage. First, most data won‚Äôt be statistically significant. Second, it can create a data driven culture too early. This is the same as optimizing growth practices too early.</p>

<p>So what are the user behavioural patterns that are most important for a startup pre-Product market fit? Here‚Äôs a few areas to focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the core engagement loop - how an individual behaves in the product. This includes time spent, frequency, and other core events. Once you know this loop, ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù is about getting users to this core loop more frequently.</li>
  <li>What happens in the first few seconds / minutes - this is related to the above. Knowing what users are trying to do becomes apparent in this early period. Dig into it with qualitative methods (interviews) to understand user motivations.</li>
  <li>What drives Organic behaviour - What are the organic acquisition channels that are bringing users to your product. This will inform where to fuel the fire through paid approaches.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are only a few, but the fewer the better in this stage. It‚Äôs important to have data available to answer questions, but not too much that you‚Äôre drowning in useless information.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In product development, discovery is the process of determining what to build.</p>

<p>Discovery takes different forms at every startup. Rightfully so because what it means to validate an idea can be very different in one company. For some ideas, a paper prototype is enough, for others you need to ship something in market to really test if it will work.</p>

<p>Being too close to either end of the spectrum is dangerous. On one end, a company may lose great ideas because of a false negative validation. On the other, every idea gets shipped and development becomes very expensive.</p>

<p>Apple used a prototyping process to come up with the original iPhone. Facebook ships hundreds of small a/b tests to see whether a feature works. A new lean startup can often validate an idea with a Google doc or landing page.</p>

<p>As you improve the discovery process, it helps to build intuition for future decisions.</p>

              A Conversation about Software and Empathy at Work
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I had a great conversation today that I wanted to capture. It was about a familiar theme - software, productivity and empathy.</p>

<p>My theory is that knowledge work, especially that in teams, requires a deeper understanding of individuals. However, there is no dominant way to accelerate a team from forming to performing. There is a lot (maybe billions of hours) of lost productivity because of simple conflicts that could be prevented with a little more empathy.</p>

<p>I wonder if software can help.</p>

<p>The software to help knowledge work has helped us connect and automate - but 
hasn‚Äôt really helped us understand each other. Yes there are personality tests and those are useful, but they are tried and seldom revisited.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to estimate the size of this as an opportunity - productivity isn‚Äôt tracked, let alone consistently that gives us any empirical evidence. But anecdotal experience and the stories of work are filled with conflict that could have been prevented with greater empathy for each other.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm really interested to see how software will move to solving those higher order problems.</p>

              A Few Thoughts About Focus
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This post is just a few disconnected thoughts I‚Äôve been holding about the topic of <strong>focus</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Focus is a skill.</strong> Like other skills, it requires practice. For knowledge work, it‚Äôs arguably the most important skill. It‚Äôs a foundational ability we can apply towards building products, selling, writing code, or any other job.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus is about serial execution</strong>. Adding goals to a plan is easy, whether it‚Äôs a daily to-do or a yearly strategy - everything seems <em>possible</em> with the time and resources at our disposal. Then, we don‚Äôt specify the order of operations and and try to execute everything <em>in parallel</em>, completing a little bit of everything but also, nothing at all. When you operate with focus, you operate serially - one task at a time. In the end, more gets done. This is deceptively simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>Focus has been a personal issue for many years, and I‚Äôve found it very difficult to keep focus for long periods of time on just about <em>anything</em>.</p>

              Setting up Learning Loops
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A learning loop is a habit of continually learning from one‚Äôs actions.</p>

<p>To build a learning loop into a team cadence, you require (a) a planning process to make decisions and (b) an infrastructure of data and insight that informs planning decisions.</p>

<p>A planning process is simple to understand- it‚Äôs a regular process of looking forward and planning work within some time frame - a week, quarter, or year.</p>

<p>The tricky part is setting up an information infrastructure. This include information on customers that leads to net new products and features (customer development). It also includes the behavioural data about how a specific product or feature is doing. This infrastructure takes a while to build and should be considered a product in and of itself.</p>

<p>Part of the infrastructure are the events (meetings) to learn how things are going, and surface different perspectives on the same data. These often become the most important meetings for a team because they complete the learning loop.</p>

<p>Team learning takes work and intentional effort - but it pays dividends in the long run.</p>

              <p>The early days at a startup are great - they are full of optimism and energy. But they also need to be the most focused towards the pursuit of product market fit.</p>

<p>Startups can get caught up in the energy of the start, but very quickly lose focus of their real goal. This happens through excessive fundraising, focusing on external events vs business milestones</p>

<p>What brings everything back on track is <em>the pursuit of learning</em>. Startups are nothing more than a hypothesis being tested in market - producing learning. And they are successful - a lot of capital.</p>

<p>Learning habits are especially important for product focused startups. Learning can come through a continual conversation with users, a good habit of looking at the right data at the right time, and being introspective about your learning processes itself.</p>

              Problem Space vs. Solution Space
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Product management is the practice of facilitating problem solving. The simplest mental model I‚Äôve used is to divide this into two domains - the problem space and solution space.</p>

<p>In the first, you are operating in the <em>problem space</em>. In this space, the goal is to <strong>create the right product</strong>, with as much possible data in a reasonable time frame. This can involve user interviews, existing data, and other forms of research. The more you operate in this space, the better you understand the problem, and the more you can rely on your intuition to build the right thing.</p>

<p>In the second step, you‚Äôre operating in the <em>solution space</em>. The goal here is to <strong>create the product right</strong>, again with limited resources and timeframe. This involves multidisciplinary skills like design and development, and is the most visible part of product management. Too often companies get stuck in this space, spending too much time to figure out the right approach to something. I‚Äôve also seen the opposite - companies getting too caught up in the problem space and never taking the time to build scalable solutions to the problems that they already deeply understand.</p>

<p>As a product manager, your goal is to osscilate your and your teams attention between these two phases. There is no right balance - only that the <em>wrong</em> balance is ignoring one phase altogether.</p>

<p>India has a very rich and diverse literary tradition, and Wattpad is the perfect place to help it grow.

This partnership will help accelerate the growth of those communities.</p>

<p>For our writer community in India, and those looking to reach an Indian audience - this partnership will open opportunities. Wattpad stories in India will turn into books, TV shows, and yes, Bollywood films.</p>

<p>At its simplest, a form is a method of gathering structured user input, which is often then sent to a server to respond with some behaviour. What has changed is the nature of the input. Mobile phones have allowed for context like location to be implicitly added. This can create products like Uber, which one can liken to a ‚Äòform for requesting a car‚Äô.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is a common scenario in new startups.</p>

<p>You just completed a big launch that involved the whole design, engineering and product teams. The launch went well. Everyone is excited, but the development team is now asking - what‚Äôs next? What are we going to build? The product team was so busy preparing for launch they didn‚Äôt have the time to build a full backlog for v1.1.</p>

<p>This is a common symptom that highlights a few issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Product, design and development teams don‚Äôt have an established rhythm. This includes the common practices of planning and retrospectives. Once this exists it‚Äôs the default mode to fall back into after a major feature launch which can often result in spikes of work.</li>
  <li>There probably isn‚Äôt a  product discovery process going where product and design are working on validating concepts in search of the right product to build. If this exists it becomes the source of all work for the development team in the delivery track.</li>
  <li>There may not be a shared understanding of users and their core problems. This understanding helps to guide decisions and fill in a lot of blanks. So even if there‚Äôs nothing in the backlog, a developer with a very good understanding of user problems will most likely improve the product vs. one that may just build something they think is right.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a common and solvable problem - sometimes with some very small changes.</p>

              Empathy and Software
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is a rewrite of yesterday‚Äôs post about understanding each other better through software. The question it explores is - How can software play a role in creating and promoting empathy? More importantly - how and where <em>should</em> it play that role?</p>

<p>This is a challenging and unbounded problem.  It‚Äôs difficult to know where to start.</p>

<p>Empathy is defined as ‚Äúthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.‚Äù</p>

<p>Technology has helped in building the foundation. To understand, we need to be able to connect and communicate with each other. We‚Äôre here - everyone is for all intents and purposes, connected.</p>

<p>But, technology (networks in particular) hasn‚Äôt gone much farther to <em>create</em> understanding, let alone ‚Äòshared feelings‚Äô. This can become esoteric very quickly, so I‚Äôm interested more in areas where <em>empathy creates value</em>. This is the case for knowledge workers working in team environments, i.e. the majority of startups today.</p>

<p>So, what can software do to create empathy in a team environment? Breaking this down into sub-problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How can software help us understand each other and our personalities?</li>
  <li>How can software help us resolve conflicts?</li>
  <li>How can software help us become better listeners?</li>
  <li>How can software help us express ourselves more authentically?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just the start. This is an area that I think we need to explore further. As software moves to higher order problems I imagine more problems of this nature coming to the surface.</p>

<p>But such an obvious problem has such a large and unbounded problem space that it‚Äôs difficult to know where to start.</p>

<p>There are products that exist to help us with personality assessments, but most are point in time snapshots. There are hundreds of products to help with workflows but none have the context of our personalities that might help to optimize how things get done.</p>

  <li>Culture, an abstraction of the behavioural norms and connective strength of the companies people</li>

  <li>Operations, an abstraction that captures the way in which work happens - the people, processes and infrastructure in place to make things function.</li>

<p>Abstractions are useful when they simplify something complex to make it more understandable.

              The Broken Credit Loop (by Anish Acharya)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p><a href="https://twitter.com/illscience">Anish Acharya</a>, VP Product at Credit Karma (who I‚Äôm lucky to call a good friend) recently shared his thoughts on everything wrong with credit bureaus. It‚Äôs an excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/illscience/status/1102326084538851328">thread</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The core loop is (of course) that consumers build credit for access to financial products and the way they manage those financial products drives their score and access to future financial products.</p>

  <p>Both parts of the loop suffer from inefficiencies that badly harm consumers - mispricing and ‚Äúmisscoring‚Äù. Let‚Äôs consider them in turn.</p>

  <p>On mispricing: It‚Äôs well understood that there is massive mispricing problem for financial products; for example, the dispersion of APRs given a fixed credit score on an auto loan are tremendously wide despite all of these folks being equally credit worthy [lender view].</p>

  <p>This problem is increasingly getting solved by companies like Credit Karma who are making these markets efficient with technology. The magnitude of this problem is staggering (in the auto loan example above mispricing costs US consumers ~$31bn per yr).</p>

  <p>On ‚Äúmis-scoring‚Äù: What‚Äôs much less well understood is that consumers are also fundamentally ‚Äúmis-scored‚Äù - in many cases their score and report doesn‚Äôt represent their true credit worthiness and this mostly acts to their detriment.</p>

  <p>For example, there are many millions of erroneous / fraudulent collections on consumer‚Äôs reports and many consumers are either unaware they exist or are unaware that they can be remedied.</p>

  <p>Or, as in your example, folks who you wouldn‚Äôt consider a ‚Äúlender‚Äù like utilities or medical put small collections on your report which you would pay if you knew about them. Sadly many consumers never notice and will be punished when they need credit next.</p>

  <p>Also consider the cold start problem where you need credit to get credit, which usually means getting a credit card. However most of these consumers have been paying rent and utilities, which can (and are just starting to be) used as an indicator of credit worthiness.</p>

  <p>As a result millions and millions of consumers have access to worse financial products than they‚Äôre entitled to and those who have the least disposable income and are the most vulnerable are being punished the most by this market inefficiency.</p>

  <p>This is also why the whole cottage industry of ‚Äúcredit consulting‚Äù firms exist, though they often charge exorbitant fees and are predatory in their own right.</p>

  <p>Bureaus want to do the right thing and efficiently score consumers. However there is an incentive mismatch in that their customers are lenders and other buyers of the data. So they‚Äôre only incentivized to make credit files as representative as their customers (lenders) demand.</p>

  <p>In the (near) future we‚Äôll live in a world where consumers have credit files that represent their true credit worthiness and are always steered into the best, cheapest sources of capital.</p>

              <p>Some of the best networkers I know seem to do it effortlessly. One of the keys to their success is to invert the exercise entirely. The best way to ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù is to approach it as an exercise of adding value vs one of extracting value.</p>

<p>In simpler terms, just be helpful, and don‚Äôt seek immediate outcomes from your connections. True network value will be realized in the long term.</p>

<p>This can happen a number of ways - my favourite is to imagine yourself as a colleague to whomever you‚Äôre talking to. This colleague that is vested in the success of that person will go above and beyond to help solve someone with whatever challenges they‚Äôre facing. It helps to take initiative by offering solutions, feedback or advice for a given situation. It helps even more if you open up your own network to that individual - and any time you can volunteer towards their problems will pay back indirectly in the future.</p>

<p>Essentially - be additive to your network, and it will ultimately be the same to you.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Creative Education
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Yesterday I was <a href="/20190224/award-shows.html">discussing</a> how awards and award shows play an important role in supporting any media ecosystem.</p>

<p>A clarification first: Award shows are a profitable enterprise in and of themselves. So to call them purely a ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù role is probably unfair. That said, in reference to the content value chain (concept &gt; production &gt; distribution &gt; engagement), awards play a supporting role.</p>

<p>The second supporting ecosystem is <strong>creative education</strong>. This serves the only side of the ecosystem where creators are the customer (concept / production). Creative education institutions - e.g. film schools, arts schools - create a healthy supply of talent once an industry has matured.</p>

<p>The best of these schools measure success by how quickly they get students placed into work environments soon after their degrees are done. This ensures they are a healthy member of the creative environment.</p>

<p>When creatives in any field are successful and find fame, it inspires younger people to follow in their footsteps. This often starts with the creative education provided by these schools. The internet has changed how people are being educated altogether, so while these schools might not be as relevant as before - the value of education definitely is.</p>

<p>So while the value chain narrative for media revolves around production and distribution, we need to recognize it is only possible with creative education and award shows.</p>

              Berkshire Hathaway 2018 Letter
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Berkshire Hathaway recently published it‚Äôs <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2018ltr.pdf">2018 Annual Letter</a>. Some excerpts I enjoyed.</p>

<p>On corporate debt (I saw this making the rounds on Twitter):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We use debt sparingly. Many managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing that significant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome CEOs will be right most of the time.</p>

  <p>At rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian- roulette equation ‚Äì usually win, occasionally die ‚Äì may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company‚Äôs upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rational people don‚Äôt risk what they have and need for what they don‚Äôt have and don‚Äôt need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On optimism for the American economy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our country‚Äôs almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner. Since 1942, we have had seven Republican presidents and seven Democrats. In the years they served, the country contended at various times with a long period of viral inflation, a 21% prime rate, several controversial and costly wars, the resignation of a president, a pervasive collapse in home values, a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems. All engendered scary headlines; all are now history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On investment manager fees:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let‚Äôs put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&amp;P 500 index fund, and all dividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (the latest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1. Meanwhile, a $1 million investment by a tax-free institution of that time ‚Äì say, a pension fund or college endowment ‚Äì would have grown to about $5.3 billion.</p>

  <p>Let me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paid only 1% of assets annually to various ‚Äúhelpers,‚Äù such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would have been cut in half, to $2.65 billion. That‚Äôs what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achieved by the S&amp;P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.</p>

              <p>I just watched the Oscars like probably the rest of the world.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to see the awards for just the show. But they play an important role in supporting a media ecosystem, on both the creator and consumers side of the market.</p>

<ul>
  <li>High profile awards serve as motivation for the top tier of a creative community. Much of it is aspiration to be recognized amongst a talented peer group.</li>
  <li>Awards serve as an excellent filter for consumers during the discovery process. The nominees and especially winners of an award will always drive new audiences to enjoy whatever film / show / book has won.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever a new media ecosystem is evolving, an award structure can become a way to  accelerate the ecosystem‚Äôs growth - to motivate creators and drive discovery.</p>

<p>Random Idea - I‚Äôve always thought it would be good for internet companies to collaborate to create an higher profile award show brand. Given their influence it can rival the Oscars, Emmy‚Äôs and Golden Globes.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Identity / Control
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This post is an exploration of the question: In today‚Äôs day and age, what does it really mean to have <em>full control</em> of your identity online?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It means that you have full <strong>portability</strong>. You can take your identity from one service to another - without having to re-enter the same information again. Importantly, when you leave a service, you know there are no digital footprints left over.</li>
  <li>It means that the <strong>value</strong> of your identity isn‚Äôt opaque to you. Essentially, you have the ability to participate in the value chain that starts with <em>your data</em>.</li>
  <li>It means you have full <strong>control</strong> to how that identity is used - whether it is used to train a model, or to deliver a specific product experience - you have the ability to opt-out of participating. Control also means you have the ability to define the privacy model for your identity that <em>you</em> are comfortable with, rather than ceding that control to a third party. Coincidentally, I read a blog post by Albert Wenger that argues that we should move towards a <a href="https://continuations.com/post/182899702695/world-after-capital-getting-over-privacy-finish">post-privacy</a> attitude, where <em>privacy</em> isn‚Äôt important at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is clearly one of the issues that we have to resolve as the internet makes it‚Äôs way into our social fabric in so many ways.</p>

              Media and Multidisciplinarity
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In just over a decade, the smartphone has become the dominant channel for all types of media. Gaming, publishing, film and tv - all are enjoyed on the smartphone more than any other device. It‚Äôs important to note that a <em>single</em> device is now used to read books, watch movies, and play games.</p>

<p>Most of the dominant media formats were created before the smartphone was launched, but this will change. In the second decade of mobile, <strong>multidisciplinarity across formats</strong> will be a dominant theme.</p>

<p>This will happen in many ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stories will look like a combination of film, books and games.</strong> There will also be some formats that have never existed (AR) that will enable new dimensions of storytelling. People will <em>play</em> more stories, not just watch or read them. The most mainstream example of this is Black Mirror: Bandersnatch on Netflix.</li>
  <li><strong>Production approaches will be shared across film, gaming, publishing and software design.</strong> To create a story, we‚Äôll be using the pre / post production structures from film, the storyboarding approaches to creating games, and the narrative design from the world of publishing.</li>
  <li><strong>Interaction will make stories managed like software product.</strong> We will come for the [entertainment] utility of a story, and stay for the network. Successful stories will build communities around them as a native part of the story experience (Fortnite is the most important example here).</li>
</ul>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been interested in how calendar apps will evolve. I‚Äôve written <a href="/20190123/calendar-network-platform.html">some hypotheses</a> on this topic before.</p>

<p>Calendars exist in so many products - as small widgets in events websites  to restaurant apps. Often there‚Äôs a booking process that starts and ends within the app - sometimes they offer the ability to add the event to your calendar, but that‚Äôs about it.</p>

<p>I wonder if we could turn this around - if start a search and booking process from the calendar itself, without having to switch contexts. Essentially take a customer centric approach to the calendar vs one optimized for service providers. It would be super convenient for me to add a time slot in my calendar for a dinner reservation at a restaurant, and then check Opentable right there.</p>

<p>I can imagine taking this to the next step and enabling to do lists  with calendar availability too. Example: adding a task like ‚ÄúGet a haircut‚Äù to your list then shows the availability of your preferred hairdresser or barber, and you can do the booking process right there (yes I need a haircut and this is on my list).</p>

<p>This feels like a problem Google and Apple should eventually get to, because there‚Äôs so much room for improvement in how we interact with calendars to manage time.</p>

              <p>There is a trend towards solving <em>higher order problems</em> in consumer and business apps.</p>

<p>Online networks brought us together, and created connection and space for conversation where there wasn‚Äôt one before. Those are no longer features that differentiate and create value - the connections and conversations are already on Facebook, WeChat, Twitter, and others.</p>

<p>Networks of tomorrow will towards building more closely towards the higher order problems. We‚Äôve created connections but need to do more to enable <em>understanding</em>. We‚Äôve enabled communities but need to do more to create a sense of <em>belonging</em>.</p>

<p>As these new networks emerge, we should be mindful of the lessons in network building that are playing out in public today. We should be creating spaces with intentionality, and an understanding of how they might be misused. That the outcomes could not be anticipated isn‚Äôt likely an acceptable excuse anymore.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Generative AI
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Research on generative models is some of the most interesting AI work that‚Äôs happening right now, and also what provokes the most discussion.</p>

<p>Recently, Open AI recently published a <a href="https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/">post</a> about language models that generate coherent paragraphs of text, and is able to perform across a number of language tasks (like translation or summarization) - without any task-specific training. They chose not to release the whole model for fear of misuse.</p>

<p>A few months ago, there was a lot of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth">discussion</a> about <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3213954">deep fakes</a>, audio and video generated by an AI model. Some examples were generated videos of Vladimir Putin and audio of Barack Obama.</p>

<p>These are a few thoughts on this topic (mostly open questions):</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, what happens when everyone has access to this and it becomes weaponized? What does that world look like and how do we deal with it? How should we be thinking about this massive change coming in what we read, watch and hear online?</li>
  <li>Many questions come up around identity. How do we know who we are talking to online is a real human? Does this matter? Should we regulate AI-generated images and text to have clear labels that they were generated by a model?</li>
  <li>How can we use generative AI to extend human creativity, or to augment human capability?</li>
  <li>What role do networks play anymore? If sufficiently good content is being generated by a machine, what is the role of content communities that previously were the only way to achieve that scale?</li>
  <li>What does this mean for journalism? When stories are being written and translated by a machine - what role does traditional journalism play in our society? Given journalism‚Äôs role in upholding democratic values - what does that mean for democracy itself?</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve probably extrapolated a bit there.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs called computers a <em>bicycle for the mind</em>. AI feels like it‚Äôs become the ‚Äúbicycle‚Äù for a computer.</p>

<p>There are two similar stories that dominated my feed today. Amazon‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/nyregion/amazon-hq2-nyc.html">reversal</a> to build HQ2 in New York, and Sidewalk‚Äôs <a href="https://betakit.com/leaked-documents-reveal-sidewalk-labs-wants-a-lot-more-than-quayside/">leaked plans</a> to build more than initially stated in it‚Äôs Quayside proposal.</p>

Amazon seems to as well, because the whole search was a ridiculous affair. I like Albert Wenger‚Äôs <a href="https://continuations.com/post/182823463265/the-lesson-from-the-amazon-hq2-fiasco">take</a>.</p>

Whether it‚Äôs through regulation, agency over data, dialogue with the public, or other means - tech companies are responsible for rebuilding this broken trust.

              Some Notes on Blockstack
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been interested in how the ‚ÄúWeb 3.0‚Äù vision is evolving, and one of the companies that is leading the path is Blockstack - a platform for developing dApps (decentralized apps).</p>

<p>Developing dApps requires a significant change in mental models for developers. But the core purpose of a development platform is the same - to help developers build, grow and monetize their apps.</p>

<p>Blockstack takes an interesting approach. All DApps are single page apps that interact with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockstack.js</code> library, which provide the core identity and storage services for a DApp. All the complexity for a Blockstack app is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">moved to clients</a> vs. on the blockchain itself through smart contracts. This makes sense since clients have the compute power, and the chain is only used for the core decentralization purposes.</p>

<p>There are 3 principles that define what type of apps developers can build using Blockstack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users own their <em>identity</em>, and have full control over how that is used. Blockstack provides the infrastructure to provide users that control. Decentralized identity is a fundamental part of every dApp.</li>
  <li>Users own their <em>data</em>, and can create apps on Blockstack using the <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/gaia">Gaia</a> decentralized storage system</li>
  <li>Users have free choice of clients. Your identity and data can be easily transferred between dApps by default. You can build a dApp but if you are using Blockstack‚Äôs Identity platform and decentralized data, it can technically be used by another app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a developer, I often want to bring decentralization into my apps in the form of <strong>data</strong> or <strong>identity</strong>. Blockstack provides an infrastructure for both of these, but it can be a bit hard to dig through. I wish their website was designed around helping developers around these principles, instead of being hidden in their <a href="https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/dapp_principles.html">docs</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://app.co/mining">App Mining</a> is a very interesting funding model. This pays developers based on contributions to the ecosystem, and rewards them on a regular basis based on app reviewers input (<a href="https://blog.blockstack.org/app-mining-game-theory-algorithm-design/">more here</a>). While this isn‚Äôt using a specific crypto token, it shares the spirit of financially supporting the developer of a dApp.</li>

              Technology Costs and Seed Investing
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Mark Suster from Upfront VC posted a an <a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-has-seed-investing-declined-and-what-does-this-mean-for-the-future-6a9572357130">analysis</a> recently about the state of the venture capital industry. In particular he focused on the seed stage market which seems to have flattened in the last few years.</p>

<p>One pattern he talked about is how closely technology costs becomes a leading indicator of seed investment behaviour. This seems obvious but these are two separated industries that impact each other. For example, AWS made it cost effective to provision infrastructure for web services, and that made it cheaper to start an startup. This led to smaller seed rounds (and a lot more of them).</p>

<p>This led me to ask - what changes are happening today that might have a similar effect on venture capital down the line? For one, it‚Äôs never been easier and cheaper to build a business on the internet. So much so that technology isn‚Äôt the biggest cost item anymore - many costs have shifted to driving distribution and sales. You can start a billion dollar retail business on Shopify, and build an enterprise startup on Slack - all with very low technology operating costs.</p>

<p>Therefore in some segments, technology operating costs may not be a predictor of how the seed venture market will evolve. I‚Äôm not quite sure exactly what will happen, but it‚Äôs interesting to see that one is a leading indicator of another.</p>

The other struggle is getting into the right mental space to start writing at that time. Setting up the environment to write in the morning is difficult (especially with two kids).</p>

<p>It‚Äôs early, so let‚Äôs see how this experiment goes.</p>

              <p>Amazon just bought Eero - the maker of the popular home mesh wifi hardware.</p>

<p>Not many details of the acquisition were revealed, especially how Alexa and Eero would integrate. From the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190211005750/en/Amazon-Acquire-eero-Customers-Connect-Smart-Home">press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By joining the Amazon family, we‚Äôre excited to learn from and work closely with a team that is defining the future of the home, accelerate our mission, and bring Eero systems to more customers around the globe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see a world where Alexa is built into all Eero hubs, and they become the smarthome hub of choice (vs hubs by Sengled or other smart device manufacturers). This makes the setup process of Smarthome products easier for customers.</p>

<p>I can also imagine the opposite - Eero technology is built into every Echo device, and is an additional value proposition for buying Echo devices. If an Echo helps you improve your wifi, it‚Äôs one more reason to put one in every room.</p>

<p>This acquisition makes a lot of sense for Amazon on a number of levels. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how it evolves.</p>

              Leadership as Attention Management
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I was having a discussion recently about leadership frameworks, and found myself stumbling with the description of the <a href="/20181020/leadership-lattice-simplified.html">leadership lattice</a> - a learning framework for management. This post explores that the Lattice is also a way of managing focus as a leader.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leadership is an exercise in managing attention. While you are ultimately accountable for <strong>everything</strong> that happens in an organization, you can only focus on one thing at a time.</li>
  <li>To decide where to focus, it helps to understand that companies and markets operate as <em>systems</em> - and can be broken down into components.</li>
  <li>The ‚Äúcompany system‚Äù starts with the <em>individual</em> and ends with the <em>impact</em> we want to see in this world.</li>
  <li>The individual components that support this: the governance model for the company, the individuals in the organization (including the leaders), the systems of organization (teams), the products and services offered, how they are received in market, and the collective impact of the company.</li>
  <li>Where to focus depends on the company stage. For example - most new startups are (should be) only concerned with how their products are received in market.</li>
  <li>This framework also acts as a filter to manage tasks. A task that doesn‚Äôt fall within one of the component categories may not be helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>The lattice was developed primarily as a learning framework - but it‚Äôs simplicity makes it useful for managing focus and being a more productive leader.</p>

              <p>Decomposibility was essential to the growth of web technology. The ‚ÄúView Source‚Äù feature, which allows you to see how a webpage is rendered (the HTML, CSS and JS), created an entire generation of programmers (myself included).</p>

<p>I wonder if this concept can benefit the world of Machine learning and AI in any way. When a technology becomes simpler to understand, it allows for innovation and ideas to come from more places. This always results in the advancement of the technology itself, but also how it gets applied.</p>

<p>Some folks seem to be working on the problem of making AI more accessible. A few months ago, Microsoft bought a small AI startup called <a href="http://www.lobe.ai">Lobe</a>. It‚Äôs goal is to make deep learning accessible to all, and it‚Äôs product is a visual drag-and-drop tool to train and build deep learning models.</p>

<p>As ML plays a larger part of our software, I expect the discussion around software decomposibility will too.</p>

<p>I decided to write this post as a quick reflection.</p>

<p>Streaks are a simple but effective mechanics to build habits. They serve as a reminder to continue habits, and are in itself a reward one a habitual behaviour is completed. A broken streak is strangely painful, which can serves as a one time cue in the <a href="http://www.atomichabits.com">atomic habits</a> framework.</p>

<p>He also poses some interesting questions about what problems we should be focused on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does liberal democracy function in an era when governments and corporations can hack humans? What‚Äôs left of the beliefs that ‚Äúthe voter knows best‚Äù and ‚Äúthe customer is always right‚Äù? How do you live when you realise that you are a hackable animal, that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces.</p>

              Is Alexa Working?

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p><a href="https://a16z.com/">A16Z</a> has been on a tear recently with blog posts and podcasts chock full of insights.</p>

<p>Yesterday Ben Evans published an interesting <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/1/29/is-alexa-working">article</a> examining Alexa and the ecosystem. In it, he examines whether Alexa has reached any kind of useful fit for Amazon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon, on the other hand, sells things. Its TV shows help it sell things by driving Prime, which pulls your purchase of children‚Äôs shoes or soap into Amazon.  It‚Äôs not yet clear what Alexa does for this. Indeed, the bear case for Alexa is that Amazon has succeeded in selling a huge number of glorified clock-radios - today, the survey data suggests that people mostly use these for audio (music and podcasts), the weather and kitchen timers, plus maybe trivia questions and controlling a smart light. If that‚Äôs all that people ever do, then as far as Amazon is concerned, Alexa is at best just a form of marketing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs a great article. I‚Äôve written a quick summary / notes for my own purpose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amazon has figured out a way to sell 100m units of <em>something</em> that is internet connected and has a direct connection with end users. They understand that because of <a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/">aggregation theory</a>, this gives them control and in turn, optionality.</li>
  <li>Amazon doesn‚Äôt yet know what to do with this, and is furiously experimenting with different use cases that can have a stronger product/market fit with consumers. It‚Äôs current use cases - acting as a smart speaker, and connecting to smart devices - probably isn‚Äôt it.</li>
  <li>One of the problems it has to solve along the path is building a voice app platform that makes it (a) easy for humans to interact with and (b) a healthy marketplace for developers to compete for user‚Äôs attention and ultimately, dollars.</li>
  <li>If it cannot figure this out, it probably runs the risk of becoming the Blackberry of smart home devices.</li>

              The Slack Product, Network and Ecosystem
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p><em>I wrote this a few months ago, but I think it deserves a repost today, in light of the <a href="https://slackhq.com/slack-has-10-million-daily-active-users">recent news</a> of Slack‚Äôs impressive growth - 85,000 paying customers, with 10+ million DAU</em>.</p>

<p>Slack is one of the fastest growing technology companies today, and perhaps the fastest growing product in the small business and enterprise software market. This is a short post is about the broader potential I see for Slack, outside of the obvious fact it is a group chat product aimed at the workplace.</p>

<p><strong>Slack is a new way of getting work done.</strong> Today‚Äôs knowledge work requires coordination and communication, and a larger portion of our jobs is <a href="/20190116/deep-work-connected-work.html">connected work</a>. With Slack and the app ecosystem, workflows that used to live in separate web applications are now <em>inside the conversation</em> itself. Users don‚Äôt have to switch contexts to change the status of a bug, to advance a deal in a sales pipeline, or to respond to a customer - it all lives within one app. Slack‚Äôs slogan is ‚Äúwhere work happens‚Äù - which I think speaks more to it‚Äôs app ecosystem than it‚Äôs capability as a group chat product. This is why I believe Slack‚Äôs biggest competition is not <em>email</em> - it‚Äôs <strong>the entire web browser</strong>. I do not believe Slack will absorb all workflows - only the ones for which there is coordination, information sharing, or handoff between people. Knowledge work requires a balance between <a href="/20190116/deep-work-connected-work.html">connected work</a> and deep solitary work.</p>

<p><strong>Slack is a new way to launch business software.</strong> With workflows embedded inside conversations, business software is being unbundled and widgetized. These widgets are not as functional as working in a web browser, but are quickly <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/introducing-actions-a-simple-shortcut-attached-to-every-slack-message-e2404414ece">getting better</a>. Eventually, Slack‚Äôs platform capabilities will include common components of the SaaS stack. Using Slack login - which provides access to the users and channels in a workplace, business software developers no longer have to worry about building a login/signup flow, user, team and permissions model. Another part of the SaaS stack is pricing - I believe Slack will (or should) launch a pricing or payments service for it‚Äôs app developers to charge individual users or channels. This pricing model would be native to Slack apps are used. All this reduces the R&amp;D effort required to build business software. On top of this, Slack provides new distribution dynamics not available in the world of business software. This is because of meteoric growth and the ability for app developers to add software inside a conversation. I imagine a new crop of SaaS companies will be created that are ‚ÄúSlack-first‚Äù vs Browser-first. This is a paradigm shift and will require a change of thinking in the world of SaaS.</p>

<p><strong>Slack is a new professional network</strong>. Slack‚Äôs user-channel-workspace structure is a more realistic model for a professional network. The channel model is a great way of encapsulating the connections and structures at work. The addition of <a href="https://slackhq.com/introducing-shared-channels-where-you-can-work-with-anyone-in-slack">shared channels</a> between workspaces helps to create connections between users and teams across workplaces. One user can also join multiple workspaces, which helps to build an interest graph. For example, a Product Manager could be on their work Slack, but then also a Product Management Slack workspace, an alumni workspace, etc. This is a very <a href="/20190115/incomplete-professional-network.html">different way</a> than how the LinkedIn network is structured.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the continual growth of Slack and the app ecosystem around it.</p>

              <p>Today is <a href="https://letstalk.bell.ca/">Bell Let‚Äôs Talk day</a>, a campaign to create awareness and reduce the stigma surrounding mental health. This is something that we as a technology industry should talk about more often.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our standards for success are increasing. Change is happening faster than it was before, and what success looked like a few years ago seems modest today. This can become a breeding ground for anxiety.</li>
  <li>We are more connected and are sharing more about our lives than ever before - but often only the good parts. Influencer culture means there are a lot of facades online, and no one really shares their failures in public. This can quickly lead to feelings of self doubt. The realities are often different - victories are not always what they seem, and neither are the failures.</li>
  <li>We are also in an age of hyper self awareness and constant measurement. We track every step, every hour we spend, and every calorie we eat. These create a feeling of competition (and potential disapointment) in every aspect of our lives.</li>
  <li>The prevailing advice is to suck it up and just work harder. Persistence is key, and influencing big change will require extra effort. But that doesn‚Äôt have to come with the culture of hustle porn, or being busy all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>We work to make impact but we also bring our whole [imperfect] selves to work every day. Mental health affects everyone, and this is a conversation we should have more often.</p>

              <p>I was recently listening to an episode of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-knowledge-project-with-shane-parrish/id990149481?mt=2&amp;i=1000428228403">The Knowledge Project</a>  podcast, featuring Josh Wolfe from Lux Capital.</p>

<p>He spoke about many things, one being a trend towards technology trending closer to our physical selves. About how we used to talk about computers as ENIAC mainframes that needed their own room - but now literally wear them 24/7 in the form of Apple Watches and AirPods.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly- and had a similar observation in a post on <a href="/20190105/software-and-plastic.html">Software and Plastic</a>. The physical distance between us and our technology is getting smaller. What will that world look like? What happens when we start wearing our software, living in it, and potentially embedding it into our bodies?</p>

<p>We will have to pay even closer attention to the people using these products - observing, listening and understanding their lives. Making software has always been about the people; as it gets closer to us, it will be even more so.</p>

<p>Second, technology products will go beyond software to physical goods and materials. It will be important to understand many crafts outside of software to build a consumer technology product. When software becomes a part of <em>everything</em>, it won‚Äôt be enough for software products practitioners to only understand the ‚Äútechnology‚Äù side of their products. This will require multidisciplinarity.</p>

<p>Above all, making technology products will look very little like it does today and I‚Äôm pretty excited about those changes.</p>

              <p>The convergence of software interface design and development has been an long running trend - and especially so in recent years.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve abstracted complexity from many parts of the development process, making it more approachable than it has ever been. This leads to more developers, more diverse ideas, and more software that helps real people around the world.</p>

<p>Design tools are also using development workflows (like version control) and even underlying technology. A recent example of this is the prototyping tool Framer using React for all components.</p>

<p>Merging the two fields means developers and designers are able to lend their skillsets to each other. We are at the point where a design prototype can <em>almost</em> become a launchable app or website to test with real users.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a> framework, the View and Controller have design and development overlap. But, the Model and database is mostly development. While design prototypes can be connected to real data with an API, the prototype and database are completely independent.</p>

<p>It would be powerful if a prototyping tool also enabled a stronger connection with the database layer. For example, if Framer/Sketch also connected with a library like GraphQL. It would be additionally powerful if the data structure was <em>inferred</em> from a prototype based on the types of UI elements being used. It would allow for designers to develop the infrastructure of the app, and potentially launch their database driven prototypes in market.</p>

<p>This convergence is bound to happen, and maybe already is (and hasn‚Äôt been announced). And if not this, design and development will continue trending towards each other in other ways. Tools will get more powerful <em>and</em> easier to use, and this will enable more ideas to turn into real products.</p>

              The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>We‚Äôve moved into a post capital world, where attention is the scarcest resource - and therefore the one with most value. Albert Wenger wrote a book on this topic, <a href="http://worldaftercapital.org">The World After Capital</a>, in which he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Technological progress has shifted scarcity for humanity. When we were foragers, food was scarce. During the agrarian age, it was land. Following the industrial revolution, capital became scarce. With digital technologies scarcity is shifting once more. We need to figure out how to live in a World After Capital in which the only scarcity is our attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A new book by Shoshanna Zuboff called <a href="https://amzn.to/2Te2wDi">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> discusses how technology powerhouses have created a new, <em>mutant</em> form of capitalism which uses our data as a raw material.</p>

<p>The Guardian provides an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">in-depth commentary</a> on the book and the concept of surveillance capitalism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The headline story is that it‚Äôs not so much about the nature of digital technology as about a new mutant form of capitalism that has found a way to use tech for its purposes. The name Zuboff has given to the new variant is ‚Äúsurveillance capitalism‚Äù. <strong>It works by providing free services that billions of people cheerfully use, enabling the providers of those services to monitor the behaviour of those users in astonishing detail ‚Äì often without their explicit consent.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>She also writes about how Internet services use only a fraction of the data they collect to actually improve the service itself. The rest of it often fed into a machine learning model and is sold as predictive analytics software or part of a data product. In essence, data gets treated as a valuable raw material. One that is easy to create and manipulate in any way companies choose - with little agency or value transfer to customers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúSurveillance capitalism,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúunilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioural data. <strong>Although some of these data are applied to service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioural surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as ‚Äòmachine intelligence‚Äô, and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later.</strong> Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call behavioural futures markets. <strong>Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behaviour.</strong>‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She also writes about the <em>threat to democracy</em> posed by surveillance capitalists:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These dangerous asymmetries are institutionalised in their monopolies of data science, their dominance of machine intelligence, which is surveillance capitalism‚Äôs ‚Äúmeans of production‚Äù, their ecosystems of suppliers and customers, their lucrative prediction markets, their ability to shape the behaviour of individuals and populations, their ownership and control of our channels for social participation, and their vast capital reserves. We enter the 21st century marked by this stark inequality in the division of learning: they know more about us than we know about ourselves or than we know about them. These new forms of social inequality are inherently antidemocratic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone that has spent a many years of my career as a ‚Äúsurveillance capitalist‚Äù of sorts - it‚Äôs really important that we ask ourselves some of these questions. This level of scrutiny - about what data to collect and how to use it - helps us become better as an industry.</p>

              The Calendar as a Network and Platform
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p><em>This is a repost with some small edits - I wrote about this topic <a href="/20180930/calendar-product-platform.html">earlier</a>.</em></p>

<p>The calendar is one of the most used apps in our smartphones. It is an indispensible utility. Some use it casually for reminders, and for others calendars dictates their day - it becomes the truest representation of our priorities. Often until an event is on the calendar, it isn‚Äôt happening.</p>

<p>Despite this, our calendar software remains fairly undeveloped. It is not a far cry from the one that was preloaded with the original iPhone in 2007. Managing your life through today‚Äôs calendar apps is still full of friction - and from personal experience can become the sole reason why events don‚Äôt take place. For some, it is so cumbersome that it requires a full time assistant. This is an expensive problem.</p>

<p>I believe this is for a few reasons, centered around two fundamental design flaws.</p>

<p>First, <strong>the calendar is an inherently social app that we are all forced to play in single player mode</strong>. We plan events with colleagues, friends and family, but the social mechanics of event planning feels like a bad turn based game. The lack of real time back and forth, the consistent context switching between our communication apps and calendars is a massive point of frustration.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>the primary calendar abstraction as a ledger of time is woefully incomplete</strong>. Events have way more nuance - whether it‚Äôs the decisions leading up to acceptance, the last minute flurry of activity close to events, or sharing meeting notes with attendees. All these activities require context switching that could be unnecessary. Working through a calendar today is like doing all your accounting directly on the ledger - it works, but it can drive you crazy.</p>

<p>Just fixing these two would be enough - but the calendar is also highly underleveraged.</p>

<p><strong>Calendars are a utility, but can also be a network and platform</strong>. They contain long term intentions through events - meetings, social gatherings, even vacations - which is central to to reservation centric businesses and service providers. A calendar can become a central distribution point for these businesses.</p>

<p>This is best illustrated by some use cases. For example - airlines can automatically send me flight deals when they see I‚Äôve booked off certain dates for vacation. I can automatically book service providers without explicit contact by adding an event to my calendar and getting real time feedback on availability. Restaurants can even ‚Äúbid‚Äù for future time in a shared calendar with my friends, sending us offers on deals on days where we are all free (this is just an example, perhaps with some privacy concerns).</p>

<p>As mobile enters it‚Äôs second decade - I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how calendar software might evolve to help address some of these problems. I think there is a lot of potential here.</p>

              A Warning from Davos
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>There are <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/dealbook/world-economic-forum-klarman.amp.html">two</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-investor-seth-klarman-in-a-rare-interview-offers-a-warning-davos-should-listen/amp">excellent</a> articles today on the same topic - the letter from investor Seth Klarman that is making the rounds at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p>

<p>It covers many topics, like the broader responsibility that companies today must accept.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For a generation of business leaders, maximizing shareholder value has been a central doctrine, a theory that is invoked to justify cutting jobs and benefits in order to reward investors with dividends and stock buybacks. But, in a speech at Harvard Business School last fall, Klarman argued that American capitalism has been damaged by the obsession with short-term stock prices. ‚ÄúDoes anyone really believe that shareholders are the only constituency that matters: not customers, not employees, not the community or the country or Planet Earth?‚Äù he asked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He emphasized that business cannot operate blind to today‚Äôs social and political climate.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It can‚Äôt be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions. [‚Ä¶] Social frictions remain a challenge for democracies around the world, and we wonder when investors might take more notice of this. Social cohesion is essential for those who have capital to invest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also warns of the rising amount of sovereign debt in the US, Canada, France and other nations. From the NYT article:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For one thing, he details the way virtually every developed country has taken on mounting debt since the financial crisis in 2008, a trend that he says could lead to a financial panic. He cites the increasing ratio of government debt to gross domestic product from 2008 to 2017, to a point exceeding 100 percent in the United States and nearing that figure in France, Canada, Britain and Spain.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúThe seeds of the next major financial crisis (or the one after that) may well be found in today‚Äôs sovereign debt levels,‚Äù he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Klarman is especially worried about debt load in the United States, what it could mean to the dollar‚Äôs status as the world‚Äôs reserve currency and how it could ultimately affect the country‚Äôs economy.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúThere is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúBy the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.‚Äù</p>

              Corporate Debt Risks
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>An interesting <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corporate-debt-risks-20190120-story.html#nws=mcnewsletter">article</a> in the LA Times today about the increasing amount of corporate debt taken on by well known US companies. This is not new - <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/as-fed-to-oaktree-fret-risks-leveraged-loans-hit-new-milestone">Bloomberg</a> reported the same thing in October 2018 as well.</p>

<p>Some key points, with quotes from the LA Times article:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The amount of corporate debt has significantly increased in the last few years. Low interests rates are making it very easy for companies to take on large amounts of corporate debt to finance their growth.
    <blockquote>
      <p>‚ÄúBecause the loan market got so attractive, we ended up seeing a lot more companies going to the loan market,‚Äù said Christina Padgett, head of leveraged finance research at ratings firm Moody‚Äôs Investors Service. ‚ÄúCompanies can borrow a bunch of money relatively affordably, do what they want to do with relatively little constraints and still service their debt.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Further fueling the growth in leveraged loans were the near-zero interest rates put in place by Federal Reserve officials during and after the Great Recession to try to spur economic growth.</p>

      <p>The effect of those low rates rippled through the financial system. They lowered the cost of borrowing to make it more attractive to companies seeking to make acquisitions or refinance their debt ‚Äî even if they had to take out a leveraged loan.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>At the same time, the standards for those loans are getting lower.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen went public this fall with her worries about what she called a ‚Äúhuge deterioration‚Äù in the standards for those loans, which make it easier for indebted companies to take on more debt. [‚Ä¶] And in its financial stability report in November, the Fed said that although default rates for leveraged loans remained low, ‚Äúcredit standards for new leveraged loans appear to have deteriorated over the past six months.‚Äù</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>This means many companies are getting loans that they won‚Äôt be able to repay.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Because those companies with non-investment-grade ratings are highly leveraged, the chances are greater that they won‚Äôt pay back a loan. For that reason, the interest rate needs to be higher to offset that risk. The higher interest rate makes the loans desirable to investors seeking a greater return on their money.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>This is very similar to the housing crisis in 2008, but maybe not as risky.
    <blockquote>
      <p>The risks aren‚Äôt nearly as widespread as they were during the housing bubble, when the percentage of all mortgages that were subprime jumped to about 20%. Leveraged loans, while growing rapidly, account for less than 5% of the more than $42-trillion U.S. fixed income debt market, which also includes corporate and municipal bonds.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

              Weekly Planning
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Every Sunday for the few months I‚Äôve started a weekly planning and reflection habit. It‚Äôs one of my favourite productivity hacks.</p>

<p>During the practice I reflect on the week past and plan for the week ahead.</p>

<p>Reflection follows a simple structure - what went well, what didn‚Äôt and what changes I want to consider for next week. I typically set a goal for the week so I use this as a chance to evaluate that too.</p>

<p>During planning for the following week, I set a weekly goal and create a todo list for every day of the week. A week follows familiar patterns and it‚Äôs helpful to consider that in planning. Thinking about the week holistically also avoids packing a single day with too many commitments. Certain tasks are batched for days they are best suited (e.g. home tasks happen only on Saturday).</p>

<p>After the exercise is complete I can see what the week is going to look like. The preparation is helpful and keeps me focused on any given day.</p>

<p>I update the daily lists every morning, and move things to different days if needed.</p>

<p>All of this happens in one Simplenote post.</p>

<p>The act of weekly planning is a great way to start off the week, and has helped me take more control of my time. I hope you find it helpful too.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Growth
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I will be at the <a href="https://fi.co/curriculum/5801">Founder Institute</a> tomorrow talking about growth and growth teams. I‚Äôm using this as a chance to get my thoughts together on the topic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The growth practice has matured. It wasn‚Äôt long ago we were talking about hacking our way to growth. Startups have recognized it‚Äôs importance, gone through the missteps and learned many things along the way. But progress couldn‚Äôt have happened without shared information from those on the frontlines. There are so many Medium posts, blogs, and books dedidcated to growth. There are even formal training and events. These have accelerated the growth practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From funnels to flywheels, we have better mental models for growth. The funnel is no longer enough to capture the dynamics of networks and marketplaces. Ecosystems are better modelled as flywheels so it‚Äôs easier to see how different sides interact with each other (e.g. creators and consumers). It also helps to understand the possible downstream impacts of any change. Focusing only on a funnel or a specific stage of a funnel is a limited view - growth has now taken a systems thinking approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The foundation of a good growth practice is data. Whether it is experiment frameworks, reporting tools or segmentation analysis - all depend on a good data infrastructure in place. Luckily many tools are available off the shelf to help startups get going (e.g. Taplytics of A/B testing, Mixpanel for reporting, etc).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are now some well known best practices for a growth function. Growth teams require a shared mental model (a growth model), the infrastructure to experiment quickly (technical &amp; data), good goalsetting practices (SMART), diversity of experiments (bottoms up not top down), and maybe most important - a culture that seeks learning. In early stage startups - <em>everyone</em> is on the growth team so this can be seen in everything the company does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growth at all costs isn‚Äôt true anymore (really, it never was). Bad things will happen when we don‚Äôt consider the second order impacts of growth, or maintain a negative ecosystem purely for growth reasons. These consequences are being discussed in the news everyday.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

              <p>It‚Äôs late, the kids are finally in bed. It‚Äôs snowing outside and quiet inside. These are the dream hours for writing, but the words aren‚Äôt coming easy. Writer‚Äôs block; a familiar feeling.</p>

<p>Walking, reading, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Freewrite">freewriting</a> - all have helped to a degree. But I often default to a method that I‚Äôve found most effective.</p>

<p>I ask - <strong>what would <em>future you</em> find helpful?</strong></p>

<p>Asking the question sparks many topics. Sometimes they are familiar, like tech or mental models. Other times they require research, and the post just becomes an executive summary. Other times I choose topics that have been on my mind for a while, and putting them into writing lightens my <em>future</em> cognitive load.</p>

<p>Many of the posts on this blog have come from asking that question. I‚Äôve referred back to those posts, sent them to people to illustrate my thinking.</p>

<p>This post itself is a reminder of that tool. If you‚Äôre ever blocked for words, you might find it helpful too.</p>

              Jack Bogle
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The name <a href="https://g.co/kgs/kVJonA">Jack Bogle</a> wasn‚Äôt familiar to me until I read of his recent passing. He created the world‚Äôs first index fund. He was also the founder of the Vanguard group and huge proponent of low costs in mutual funds.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm surprised his name isn‚Äôt mentioned more in the news alongside investment legends like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio. His work has likely benefited individual investors more than <em>anyone</em> else.</p>

<p>Vanguard‚Äôs <a href="https://pressroom.vanguard.com/news/Press-Release-Vanguard-Announces-Passing-Of-Founder-Jack-Bogle-011619.html">official statement</a> of his death also added some history of the first index fund:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1976, Vanguard introduced the first index mutual fund‚ÄîFirst Index Investment Trust‚Äîfor individual investors. Ridiculed by others in the industry as ‚Äúun-American‚Äù and ‚Äúa sure path to mediocrity,‚Äù the fund collected a mere $11 million during its initial underwriting. Now known as Vanguard 500 Index Fund, it has grown to be one of the industry‚Äôs largest, with more than $441 billion in assets (the sister fund, Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, has $221.5 billion in assets). Today, index funds account for more than 70% of Vanguard‚Äôs $4.9 trillion in assets under management; they are offered by many other fund companies as well and they make up most exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For his pioneering of the index concept for individual investors, Mr. Bogle was often called the ‚Äúfather of indexing.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was very customer centric - in his case being a champion for low costs and transparency in the mutual fund industry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A champion of the individual investor, Mr. Bogle is widely credited with helping to bring increased disclosure about mutual fund costs and performance to the public. His commitment to safeguarding investors‚Äô interests often prompted him to speak out against practices that were common among his peers in other mutual fund organizations. ‚ÄúWe are more than a mere industry,‚Äù he insisted in a 1987 speech before the National Investment Company Services Association. ‚ÄúWe must hold ourselves to higher standards, standards of trust and fiduciary duty. Change we must‚Äîin our communications, our pricing structure, our product, and our promotional techniques.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His impact is quite literally going to compound for generations, and you can‚Äôt really say that about many people.</p>

It‚Äôs a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Communication tasks - email, chat - are often considered the enemy of deep work. Switching from documents to email to is considered a distraction. But communication is essential to the work, so how do we resolve this conflict?</p>

<p>We‚Äôre seeing this happen in apps like Slack and Front, which interleave app workflows into the conversation itself. Slack for chat and Front for email.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs feels like an new mode of work - I‚Äôm calling it <em>connected work</em>. Where everyone is talking, sharing  context and most importantly - acting together. <strong>Connected work is high bandwidth communication <em>and</em> simultaneous productive output.</strong></p>

<p>Many light workflows are best suited in connected work environments - moving tickets forward in a queue, approvals and signoffs, and responding to customer support tickets. All of these are enabled by chat interleaved with data and workflows from other apps.</p>

<p>Connected work accelerates the pace of decisions and information sharing in a team, and also fosters an environment of transparency. I expect to see more and more of our workflows becoming connected over time.</p>

              An Incomplete Network

              <p>Our professional network is <a href="https://medium.com/@lancengym/the-endgame-for-linkedin-is-coming-31d4a8b2a76">broken</a>. Well - more so incomplete. LinkedIn‚Äôs value is primarily in external facing roles - recruiting and some outreach - but not much else.</p>

<p>The perceived value of a LinkedIn connection has also gone to zero. It was driven first by a race to the coveted ‚Äú500+ Connections‚Äù on your profile. LinkedIn did a great job early on to incentivize us to fill out our profiles and start connecting with people. Now an additional connection is meaningless even if something clever is happening with that graph in the background. In the best cases, conversation is quickly converted into email.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs deeply ironic that for most, the world‚Äôs biggest professional network isn‚Äôt used more at work.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs an argument  that it‚Äôs fine - after all LinkedIn was designed from the ground up to be a tool to <em>use your network</em>. Maybe the true value of the network has been fully realized through recruiting and sales. Even though it feels like network abuse more than use, perhaps it is all working as designed, and this is the end game.</p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt feel like this is true. I think there is a need for a space to express your true identity at work - your strengths, what you‚Äôre working on, and how best you operate. A profile that is actively used at the workplace and one that moves with you throughout your career.</p>

<p>I think our notion of a ‚Äúprofessional network‚Äù has a missing dimension, and this may be it.</p>

              Canada&#39;s Immigration Plan 2019-2021
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Every year, the Ministry of Immigration releases an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/annual-report-parliament-immigration-2018/report.html">annual report</a> to Parliament on immigration. It‚Äôs a comprehensive report to understand what the ministry is planning for the next few years. This year the government is planning ahead in a 3-year horizon vs single.</p>

<p>Some higlights from the Minister‚Äôs letter this year:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With this in mind, Canada welcomed more than 286,000 permanent residents in 2017. Over half were admitted under Economic Class programs. The number also included over 44,000 resettled refugees, protected persons and people admitted under humanitarian, compassionate and public policy considerations.</p>

  <p>Also in 2017, the Government of Canada adopted a historic multi-year levels plan to responsibly grow our annual immigration levels to 340,000 by 2020, with 60 percent of the growth in the Economic Class. Growing immigration levels, particularly in the Economic Class, will help us sustain our labour force, support economic growth and spur innovation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This table breaks it down:</p>

<p>It‚Äôs great to see that this government responding positively especially in light of what‚Äôs happening in the US. Immigration is essential to our economy and social fabric.</p>

<p>There is a lot we are doing right but also plenty of room for improvement. The physical and cultural shift as an immigrant is not easy. Add to that the most common <em>new</em> immigrant issues -  language barriers, employment issues and trouble finding housing - and it becomes especially difficult. These are issues that affect all Canadians but are pronounced in the first months and years of a life move.</p>

              What&#39;s Happening in India
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>There has been an explosion of internet services in India in the last few years. Indians have come online, ready to spend their time and money.</p>

<p>This is fuelled entirely by one change - the cost of mobile data has dropped dramatically. Today, mobile data costs <strong>less that one tenth</strong> what it did just two years ago.</p>

<p>India is now one of the world‚Äôs largest consumers of mobile broadband data. It was 155th two years ago. By 2024 data usage is expected to <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/india-to-have-1-billion-smartphones-by-2024-data-usage-to-grow-by-4x-ercisson-1954167">quadruple</a> as 1 billion smartphones come online. For 2016 and 2017, India‚Äôs average data usage per SIM was the highest in the world, according to <a href="https://tefficient.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tefficient-industry-analysis-1-2018-mobile-data-usage-and-revenue-FY-2017-per-country-10-July-2018.pdf">a report by Tefficient</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/data-usage-per-sim.png" alt="Data Usage Per SIM" width="600px" /></p>

<p>By every measure this is a gigantic Internet market awakening.</p>

<p>The change was led by the new carrier Reliance Jio -  which launched a 4G only data network in 2016. Many soon followed and and this drove prices to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indians-gorging-on-mobile-data-usage-goes-up-15-times-in-3-yrs/articleshow/64432913.cms">Rs.19 per GB</a> (they were Rs. 269 in 2014). As of <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/india-top-mobile-data-consuming-nation-mukesh-ambani-1375253-2018-10-25">October 2018</a>, Jio had 250 million subscribers - less than two years after launching.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm frankly surprised how <em>little</em> we are talking about this change in North America. India is the world‚Äôs largest democracy. It is also the fastest growing economy and is expected to have the largest middle class by 2025 (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/6-surprising-facts-about-india-s-exploding-middle-class/">source</a>, <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/after-japan-india-poised-to-overtake-us-to-become-2nd-largest-middle-class-market-in-less-than-4-years/1289336/">source</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/india-middle-class.jpg" alt="India Middle Class" /></p>

<p>We can now realize the potential of India‚Äôs billion-people consumer market. This will enable all kinds of innovation and I‚Äôm excited to see that happen.</p>

<p>At the same time there is also fear. Our planet is <a href="/20181028/climate-change.html">very sick</a>, and won‚Äôt survive another billion people recklessly consuming and creating waste. We cannot ignore this as India comes online.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Venture Capital
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>There‚Äôs been some interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/1083756889089798145">discussion</a> on Twitter recently about venture capital. Specifically around how most companies should not be taking VC at all.</p>

<p>What often follows is the familiar ‚ÄòVC is evil‚Äô discourse, which seems to forget a few fundamental truths.</p>

<p><strong>VC is a very specific investment type.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>As a company accepting venture capital, it‚Äôs important to understand you are part of a broader system of fiduciary responsibility. VC firms raise money from LP‚Äôs which include pension funds, endowment funds and family offices. This will influence the dynamics between a VC and individual company.</li>
  <li>VC is often part of an LP‚Äôs high risk investment buckets. These high-risk-high-reward investments have binary outcomes - most investments will fail to realize any returns, but the ones that hit will more than make up for those failures. This binary outcome is baked into the deal - for both good situations and bad. In the latter, there is specific protection for VC‚Äôs to recoup any value if a company is sold for parts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>VC is <em>not</em> one size fits all.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Venture is appropriate  when a <em>sudden</em> influx of cash has a high likelihood of accelerating a business‚Äô chances for succeeding in it‚Äôs goals, most often capturing a market or creating a new line of business. This is when a business has found product market fit, is ready to scale, and there is significant <em>room</em> for growth (i.e. the market is big). It goes without saying that founders also have to <em>want</em> to capture that entire market.</li>
  <li>This combination of factors is rare and most companies don‚Äôt fit this criteria. When it does happen a company likely doesn‚Äôt <em>need</em> technically venture capital to survive - making it the best time to raise. When it doesn‚Äôt, a company likely isn‚Äôt ready and probably shouldn‚Äôt accept VC as a forcing function. An influx of cash almost always leads to poor decision-making when it‚Äôs not focused.</li>
  <li>You cannot blame VC when founders are going into deals with their eyes wide open. No one is forcing anyone to take their money. When it is taken, there is a value exchange and expectation. This value exchange in the form of equity (percentage ownership). It comes with well established governance structures that also may not be appropriate for all companies.</li>
  <li>Tech companies and VC often go hand in hand, mostly because of the high leverage and distribution potential of the Internet. But just because it‚Äôs an internet company, doesn‚Äôt make it <em>venture scale</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>VC is a phase vs a continual mode of operating.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Startups should think of the period that they are taking VC as a temporary period of rapid acceleration. It‚Äôs not possible nor desired to stay in this mode. Exits have a very specific purpose.</li>
  <li>When a company raises,  a board and governance structures are established to guide the company through its growth phase.</li>
  <li>The best VC‚Äôs know how to make this long term relationship much more than a financial transaction. They understand this is a people business first.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>VC has a very specific role to play in the ecosystem.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Venture has played a critical role in developing the most valuable companies on the planet today. The availability of venture capital in an ecosystem can motivate founders to start companies that swing for the fences.</li>
  <li>In an ecosystem, too much capital and not enough companies means that the dollars and expectations of a VC investment are poured into companies that are simply not ready for it yet. This leads to higher than expected failure rates especially when financial markets are unstable. It seems we may be heading this way.</li>
</ul>

<p>VC has a lot room for improvement, but too often jump to blaming the financing structure without understanding it. There are many other models of financing and acceleration often more appropriate to realize a company vision.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A short and abstract post about awareness and action.</p>

<p>Companies work like complex systems. Essential to leadership is simply developing greater <em>awareness</em> of the system in which you‚Äôre operating, and then an understanding of how to take <em>action</em> on it.</p>

<p>In the context of management - <em>awareness</em> is understanding the people, how they work together, the output of their collaboration, how that is received, and it‚Äôs broader impact. Awareness is an exercise in listening and learning.</p>

<p>Awareness is also about understanding your peer group and governance structure, and what they and their organizations need to be successful. Managing anything in an organization requires the ability to influence change in all those directions. Doing so will make you a better citizen of your organization.</p>

<p>When it‚Äôs time to take action, the awareness of a company-system helps to create change that has lasting impact.</p>

              Code and Community
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This post is about the close relationship between code and community. These thoughts were sparked by Github‚Äôs recent <a href="https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/">major announcement</a>.</p>

<p>There is a social infrastructure that underpins today‚Äôs development workflow. Building anything with code <em>requires</em> the help of communities like Stack Overflow, Github and CodePen. To the point where an [open source] technology is considered only as good as the engagement of it‚Äôs underlying community.</p>

<p>Also, when coding in a community, core software concepts like abstraction and decomposition have new dimension.</p>

<p>Abstraction - the act of removing complexity - is a foundational concept of computing. In software, abstraction happens at all levels of Code. It is accelerated in a community environment. Open sourcing is synonymous with absracting complexity so code is usable by other programmers. Exposing code to a diverse community also enables new and interesting forms of abstraction, creating new applications along the way.</p>

<p>Decomposition is another development concept that is affected by community. It is the act of breaking a system down smaller parts, often reverse-engineering to understand how something is built. This is the opposite of abstraction because it <em>creates</em> complexity. A great example of this is the View Source feature in every web browser which helps you understand how different parts of a webpage are composed. This simple feature enabled a generation of web developers (myself included), and was a catalyst for many developer communities. Taking things apart creates curiousity, opportunity for conversation, and generates ideas. Creative communities thrive on decomposition because it allows people to learn from each other. <a href="www.glitch.com">Glitch</a> is one community in particular that really understands the power of this concept.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre still in the <a href="/20181105/the-internet-just-getting-started.html">early days of the internet</a> and I‚Äôm excited to see how communities around code  evolve together.</p>

              <p>This blog started in August 2018. It was a way to kickstart a writing habit, and as a much-needed creative output during parental leave.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been four months of daily writing; almost 140 posts.</p>

<p>Posts about everything from productivity, learning frameworks, technology, immigration, mental models, and whatever else comes to mind. This has become a tool for learning, a way to think through ideas, a journal and sometimes just a bookmarking tool.</p>

<p>But I‚Äôve been pretty quiet about it - choosing not to share except occassionally to close friends. This is a familiar pattern for me, and I‚Äôm sure many others too.</p>

              A Better Trust Model for Home Services
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In a <a href="/20181005/smart-locks-home-permissions-layer.html">previous post</a>, I wrote about how smart locks enable a permissions layer for the home.</p>

<p>One of the key issues is trust - specifically - why should I allow complete strangers to come into my house while I‚Äôm not there. I suggested following the Uber / Lyft model by creating a trusted group of service providers. I think there‚Äôs better approaches.</p>

<p>Uber, Lyft and other service-based marketplaces are made of drivers and riders. Outside of a <em>post-ride</em> rating system, riders and drivers are separate communities and don‚Äôt interact. Riders don‚Äôt know who is coming to pick them up until minutes before, and vice versa for drivers. For a short interaction like a car-ride, this is just fine. The trust expectation is simply to get me from A to B <em>safely</em>. The trust expectation for a home service provider is much higher - there is more at risk when you let someone in your house while you‚Äôre not there.</p>

<p>In Uber‚Äôs marketplace, the supply side of the market (drivers) can grow independently of the demand (riders). Put another way - a driver doesn‚Äôt need a rider to join the network. What if the demand side of the market (home owners) had to explicitly invite every member of the supply side (service providers)?</p>

<p>This means contractors, nannies, cleaners could only join the marketplace through an invite from a homeowner. So, when a new homeowner joins the service, they start by invite all the service providers they trust. Over time, home owners will build a network of service providers where trust is implied, instead of relying on a rating system. This is reflective of how things work today.</p>

<p>In this model, the marketplace grows organically - it may be slower, but the connections would be more meaningful. I‚Äôm not sure if such a model exists in other marketplaces, but if it does - it would be very interesting to see how it‚Äôs worked out.</p>

              <p>This is a very quick post about a small productivity hack - to end a task by setting up for the next time you start.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems in completing any task, especially on my computer, is the amount of distractions in close reach. If open my laptop and see a web browser open, the first thing I will do is start browsing. James Clear wrote in Atomic Habits that habit forming is first about shaping your environment vs shaping your behaviour.</p>

<p>So I tried a simple trick that seems to be working - before I close my laptop, I open up Simplenote to my to-do list for the week. When I open it again, Simplenote is the first thing I see, creating a simple reminder of what I need to do.</p>

<p>This also works in writing. After I publish a post, I try to decide on what I‚Äôm going to write about tomorrow and set up the draft post. The next time I start, there‚Äôs no decision needed - I just open the draft and go.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a really a small trick and doesn‚Äôt work for everything, but I‚Äôve found it quite effective.</p>

              <p>I had a conversation recently with a friend considering moving to Canada on the topic of resume‚Äôs. He was showing me his curriculum vitae document, or CV, and asked for feedback.</p>

<p>A CV is the equivalent of a resume outside of North America. <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/cv-vs-resume-2058495">The Balance</a> has a great article comparing the two.</p>

<p>I provided my friend some feedback that I‚Äôve provided before to others - especially candidates that are used to creating lengthy CV‚Äôs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Length - Most CV‚Äôs are 2-3 pages long, and the ideal resume length is no more than one page. CV‚Äôs contain a lot of information - resume‚Äôs are about the highlights.</li>
  <li>Profile Sections - One of the most important parts of the resume is a self described profile or summary. It can be a paragraph or bulleted list, but gives employers a good sense of the candidate. Many CV‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen completely skip a summary, leaving the employer to stitch it together with work experience, education, and other sections.</li>
  <li>Show off! Experience Bullets should never list your job responsibilities, but what you accomplished. Many CV‚Äôs I‚Äôve reviewed have a detailed description of the job responsibility, company structure, and then highlight accomplishments. Those former sections can be removed in a resume - your company and job title tells a lot about responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt try to cram text on a page. It‚Äôs obvious when you are using formatting and margin tricks just to get to one page. Try to use sensibile defaults and force yourself to really prioritize what‚Äôs the important message.</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôll be updating this list with more common resume advice as it comes up.</p>

              Software and Plastic
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I recently re-read <a href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/">What Screens Want</a> by Frank Chimero. It‚Äôs an essay about the spirit and function of software in our lives.</p>

<p>In it, Chimero introduces this analogy that has stuck with me for a long time - that <strong>software is like plastic</strong>. More accurately - software has become ubiquitious in our daily life, in the same way plastics did in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs. I wanted to dig into and stretch that analogy.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/the-history-and-future-of-plastics">History and Future of Plastics</a> by the Science History Institute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>World War II necessitated a great expansion of the plastics industry in the United States, as industrial might proved as important to victory as military success. The need to preserve scarce natural resources made the production of synthetic alternatives a priority. Plastics provided those substitutes. Nylon, invented by Wallace Carothers in 1935 as a synthetic silk, was used during the war for parachutes, ropes, body armor, helmet liners, and more. Plexiglas provided an alternative to glass for aircraft windows. A Time magazine article noted that because of the war, ‚Äúplastics have been turned to new uses and the adaptability of plastics demonstrated all over again.‚Äù During World War II plastic production in the United States increased by 300%.</p>

  <p>The surge in plastic production continued after the war ended. After experiencing the Great Depression and then World War II, Americans were ready to spend again, and much of what they bought was made of plastic. According to author Susan Freinkel, ‚ÄúIn product after product, market after market, plastics challenged traditional materials and won, taking the place of steel in cars, paper and glass in packaging, and wood in furniture.‚Äù The possibilities of plastics gave some observers an almost utopian vision of a future with abundant material wealth thanks to an inexpensive, safe, sanitary substance that could be shaped by humans to their every whim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plastic products started by mimicking their natural counterparts (e.g. wood grain, leather) - but soon products were created that could <em>only be made in plastic</em>. Early software created metaphors to <a href="http://kare.com/apple-icons/">mimic familiar objects</a>.</p>

<p>Now software is something in it‚Äôs own right. The 4 biggest companies by market cap are all software companies. And software has now <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/29/everything-the-iphone-has-destroyed-in-the-last-10-years.html">replaced so many products</a> - ironically, many of them made of plastic.</p>

<p>So we are hurtling towards a world of software <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">becoming <em>everything</em></a>. We are already <a href="https://www.bynorth.com/">wearing software</a>, <a href="http://www.tesla.com">driving it</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/smart-home-devices/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=6563140011">living in</a> a world surrounded by it.</p>

<p><strong>But what happens next? What happens when software has eaten everything?</strong> There are a few questions swirling around in my head.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What might that world look like?</strong> When software becomes a part of everything, it will probably become invisible. When plastic became everything, it also <em>became nothing</em>. It didn‚Äôt disappear - it just fell out of the limelight as a new technology that offered boundless potential. It just became a part of our everyday lives.</li>
  <li><strong>Will we even recognize that software?</strong> Software is moving to a point where it‚Äôs becoming harder to <em>decompose</em>. AI is making it effectively impossible to understand how software does what it does. The future of software may just be interactions with AI models, making it out of reach for craftspeople to decompose and remix.</li>
  <li><strong>Who will create it? Will software be made by many or the few?</strong> When plastic became popular, production consolidated to a few companies. Two of the biggest - Dow Chemical and DuPont, merged in 2017 and formed the largest plastics company in the world. The rise of 3D printing is bringing plastics manufacturing to the masses, but nowhere near the scale of industry. Software has always been available, and accessible to all to create, but power has also <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fang-stocks-fb-amzn.asp">consolidated</a> in the industry. The trend towards <a href="/20180914/web3-decentralization.html">decentralization</a> might change this.</li>
  <li><strong>Will there ever be too much software?</strong> Plastic has become synonymous with consumer culture - excess and environmental damage. The victim is our <em>physical</em> environment. In the same way, software is becoming synonymous with attention-seeking and addictive behaviour - and the victim is our <em>mental</em> environment. The irony is both plastic and software might cause more harm to the very things it originally helped. Plastic started with promise - as a helpful substitute to natural materials - and is now the cause of so much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch">natural destruction</a>. Software started with a promise - as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6cs">bicycle for our minds</a> - and could be the cause of a collective <a href="https://futurism.com/former-facebook-vp-social-media-destroying-society-hes-right">societal breakdown</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are incomplete thoughts - and I‚Äôll be revisiting them later.</p>

              The Not-So-Smart-Home
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Software is eating the world, and it‚Äôs finally nibbling it‚Äôs way into our homes with  Amazon‚Äôs Alexa and Google Assistant ecosystems. Over the holidays, I decided to outfit our home with <em>all the smart things</em>.</p>

<p>We now have Alexa and Google Assistants around the home. There are Echo‚Äôs in the bedrooms, a Google Home hub in the living room, and both connected to a number of smart lights and plugs around the house. Also connected is the Nest Thermostat. Still a relatively humble setup but enough to understand how the technology can benefit our home life.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a mixed experience. There are some highlights, but we‚Äôve got a ways to go before this becomes mainstream behaviour.</p>

<p>First - the setup process is far away from <em>it just works</em>. The pain of connecting my phone to a temporary wifi network, for a hub for two smart lights - and <em>then</em> connect it to my Alexa device - it‚Äôs just not worth it. This feels the smart-home version of installing a soundcard in a  tower PC. While I was able to make everything work eventually, I don‚Äôt imagine most people will have the patience for it. On a positive note - the actual Echo and Google Hub themselves were relatively easy to get going. Integration with Google services was great and the Amazon purchase experience has been pretty good too. Also, once everything was setup, I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of creating routines.</p>

<p>That said - Daily use is still frustrating. Both Alexa and Google have issues with  speech recognition at normal volume. We find ourselves yelling across the room, often interrupting conversations if there are multiple people in the houe. We‚Äôve also found consistent issues with both devices understanding female voices. It would come as no surprise that these were trained on a majority of male voices.</p>

<p>I think both ecosystems would benefit from some more intelligent defaults - following convention over configuration. For example, there should be a automatic ‚Äúnight mode‚Äù - if it‚Äôs past 9pm and you‚Äôre talking to a smart device in a bedroom - it should talk back in a lower volume.</p>

<p>Finally - I was disappointed at the distinct lack of mention of privacy concerns in the packaging for Google Assistant and Alexa devices. Sometimes it seems like the industry isn‚Äôt learning from it‚Äôs mistakes.</p>

<p>While my early experience with the smart home has been underwhelming - I‚Äôm still very <a href="/20181005/smart-locks-home-permissions-layer.html">bullish</a> on how software can help improve our life at home.</p>

              Leadership and Systems Thinking
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/nickcandito/status/1080488425365667841">this tweet</a> today and listened to the linked A16Z podcast. The episode itself talks about a number of topics but at around 26 minutes, Ben Horowitz expands on the two predictors of great management:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Systems thinking - the ability to understand how one change affects another, and that almost <em>everything</em> is a system. Most people are not systems thinkers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perspective - The ability to really see the people in your organization - to know who they are, what their motivations are - and understand implications of your actions through their eyes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Taking a systems thinking approach to leadership is fundamental to the <a href="/20181020/leadership-lattice-simplified.html">leadership lattice</a> - the learning framework for management that I‚Äôve written about a number of times.</p>

              Changing My Investment Stack (Part 2 of 2)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In the <a href="/20181228/changing-investment-stack.html">first part</a> of this series, I detailed my move from a financial advisor to an independent brokerage, focusing on the account setup and asset transfer. In this part, I detail the steps I followed to change my investment strategy.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: This isn‚Äôt advice. Don‚Äôt follow it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Current Strategy and Allocation</strong></p>

<p>Having an advisor is a useful abstraction away from the details of your investments. You often don‚Äôt know <em>where</em> your money is - you just trust it‚Äôs in the right place. Before changing anything, I spent time to reassess my existing risk profile and strategy - and how this was reflected in my asset allocation.</p>

<p>I decided a new allocation was necessary. I was <em>over</em> diversified, some investments were pure speculation, and fees were too high.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Deciding on A New Allocation</strong></p>

<p>This is an ongoing process, and the objective was to create an allocation reflective of my financial goals and risk profile. This came through some valuable conversations with investment professionals, peers in my industry and others.</p>

<p>I won‚Äôt go into the details of my new allocation, but it is a combination of [mostly] equities and some cash to give me flexibility to buy more.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Setting Up Asset Allocation</strong></p>

<p>This was a two step process - selling the old stocks/bonds and using those proceeds, buying the same amount of the new.</p>

<p>I decided not to market time and made all my sell orders almost as soon as the transfer between brokerages was complete. The buy process is taking a little bit longer, primarily because of the recent activity in the market. I recently (<a href="/20181208/entering-bear-markets.html">wrote about</a>) investing in bear markets as well.</p>

<p>This was a long and drawn out process - especially because it was my first time and I was extra cautious. I learned a lot along the way and am looking forward to taking greater control of my investments.</p>

              Changing My Investment Stack (1 of 2)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This year I changed my approach to managing my investments and moved away from using a financial advisor to an independent broker. I also changed my investment strategy and asset allocation. This guide goes through my process for anyone considering the same transition. If you are doing this - before you do anything - understand what it means to manage your own money.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor. I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.</p>

<p><strong>Step 0: Revisit my Financial Plan</strong></p>

<p>This goes without saying, but any changes you are making to your investment strategy needs to fit within a plan. Your Financial Plan starts with understanding your current financial situation and your long term goals. Your Plan provides a path towards those goals from where you are today. Your investment strategy is a way to achieve this plan. If you have an investment strategy but no clear goals, there is no way to tell whether or not that strategy was successful.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Understand Why You Are Doing This</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to take stock of why you are (a) moving away from an advisor and (b) choosing to manage your own investments. Both of these are completely different, but people often think about one without the other. Even if you are not satisfied with your advisors fees or investment strategy, you may not want to manage it all yourself. Just be mindful of what you are doing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up All Your Accounts</strong></p>

<p>I was transitioning from a financial advisor to an independent brokerage, so this step started with research. MoneySense publishes an excellent annual <a href="https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/canadas-best-online-brokers-2018/">comparison</a> of all investment brokerages. I ended up choosing my bank‚Äôs brokerage service - primarily for convenience and trust. Right after I finished my research, Wealthsimple launched it‚Äôs commission-free <a href="www.wealthsimple.com/trade">Trade</a> product but I‚Äôm still waiting for an account to try it out. The process of setting up accounts was nots straightforward - it required going into the bank for a morning and filling out a lot of paperwork.</p>

<p>Make sure your account setup mirrors what you have with your advisor. When you are transferring funds, you have to transfer between accounts of the same type - i.e. you cannot transfer from an RRSP at one institution to a TFSA at another.</p>

<p>Note: If you are married and setting up accounts with your spouse, make sure you request the trading authority / power of attorney so that you can manage it all in one dashboard without having to switch accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3a: Making the Transition - Requesting The Transfer</strong></p>

<p>Every brokerage will give you the option to transfer from an existing financial institution. The best brokerages make this process really easy (as they should!).</p>

<p>My brokerage (Royal Bank) allows you to do this entirely online - you simply provide the institution name (there is a handy dropdown with every brokerage in Canada), your source account number and which account you want the assets transferred.</p>

<p>You can also choose to transfer in-kind (transfer the securities as-is, without selling), as cash (where all the securities would be sold before transferring), or a combination of the two. I chose to transfer everything in-kind and then do the selling on the Royal Bank side.</p>

<p>Most brokerages will charge you for transferring out (mine charged $125 + tax), but the receiving brokerage is often happy to pay for that - as long as you show them the statement where the charge was made. That means you‚Äôll need to log into your old brokerage after the transfer was made to get that statement. It often needs to be an official PDF statement for the refund, so you might have to wait until the next statement date.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3b: Making the Transition - Communicating with Your Advisor</strong></p>

<p>Once you have pushed the button and moved all your assets and cash - I would recommend you tell your advisor immediately. Many brokerages advise against thias to avoid an awkward conversation - but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed working with my advisor, and I was upfront about my decision and reasoning. He appreciated the candor and we continue to have a good friendship.</p>

<p>In the next part of this series, I‚Äôll discuss the steps I took in changing my investment strategy.</p>

              The Why and the How
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been fortunate to work with and manage some great product managers in my career. Each one had their own style and strengths. They all added dimension to my understanding of good product management.</p>

<p>One thing that was common amongst all of them - they all deeply understood the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> of their products.</p>

<p>The <em>Why</em> is what motivates customers to use a product. It drives people to take out their phones and open your app, or visit your website. The Why is about understanding people, the environments they are in, and the problems they encounter. <em>Why</em> doesn‚Äôt come easy - it often reveals itself in nuance and conversation.</p>

<p>The <em>How</em> is what customers do in a product. It‚Äôs the behaviours, the interactions, and how they feel going through your product. The How is about the measurable feedback - for an individual customer or your entire base. <em>How</em> can be easy to start, but difficult to do well. It reveals itself with intention about what to measure.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve met many PM‚Äôs who are better at one or the other. In a team, it‚Äôs not uncommon where one PM is focused on ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù and another on ‚ÄúHow‚Äù.</p>

<p>When a team lacks one of these perspectives, it‚Äôs never good. Why without How can lead to big vision without any accountability for success. How without Why leads to short term thinking because no one understands the real problem being solved.</p>

<p>When put together, How and Why provide the perspectives to build great products.</p>

              2018 Retrospective
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A quick retrospective on 2018. It was a pretty eventful year.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I became a parent to twin girls in June. I took a 6 month paternity leave to spend more time with family. Grateful to my employers (Wattpad) for a very generous parental leave policy.</li>
  <li>My parents immigrated to Canada earlier in the year after a 7 year long sponsorship process.</li>
  <li>I created a better financial plan for my family and changed our overall investment strategy, moving away from our financial advisor.</li>
  <li>Started a writing habit everyday since August. Since then - I‚Äôve written 121 posts and going strong!</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm really proud of the work that the team at Wattpad is doing. We‚Äôve had a banner year and are firing on all cylinders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the lowlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There‚Äôs a lot more uncertainty about the future. The political, social and financial structures of the world are unravelling. I‚Äôm spending too much time in the short term news cycle.</li>
  <li>A few extended bouts of anxiety, self doubt and impostor syndrome in the middle of the year slowed me down. Thanks to all the people that helped me through those times.</li>
  <li>Parenting killed all my good sleep and gym habits - not surprising, but will be changing this in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the beginning of the year, I chose not to create any specific resolutions except to develop better daily habits - no working from home, read more regularly, take care of your body. I feel good about where I ended up.</p>

              Atomic Habits: Review &amp; Notes
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I just finished <a href="www.atomichabits.com">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear.</p>

<p>This is the type of book you want to read so fast (so you can put it to use). It‚Äôs all signal and no filler.</p>

<p>The 4 step habit framework underpins the entire book but each chapter also stands on it‚Äôs own. This isn‚Äôt surprising because it started as a series of blog posts.</p>

<p>There are many takeaways from the book, and Clear has done readers a great service by creating a <a href="https://atomichabits.com/cheatsheet">cheatsheet</a> of the habits framework.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed the summaries at the end of every chapter. More books, especially non-fiction, should do this.</p>

<p>Some of the key points that I found useful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every human behaviour follows the habit loop - cue, craving, response, and reward - most times without our awareness. Building habits is about understanding and being intentional about this loop.</li>
  <li>We too often start with trying to change our behaviours directly. Instead, start by defining your identity (or desired one), and then the behaviours will follow. He writes about this <a href="https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits">here</a>. Specifically focus on the 3 layers of behaviour change - identity, process, and outcome.</li>
  <li>Behaviour change follows the path of least resistance. Set up your environment and understand yourself to prevent the cues for bad habits. This is a form of <a href="/20181001/decision-making-frameworks.html">inversion</a> applied to habit forming.</li>
  <li><em>Habit stacking</em> is about attaching a new behaviour to an existing one. It can be an effective way to start a new habit (existing behaviour becomes a cue for the new one, and can also be a reward if it‚Äôs more desirable).</li>
  <li>Sometimes, it just comes down to writing it down and saying it aloud. James provides some simple affirmation statements for habit building (called ‚Äúimplementation intentions‚Äù).</li>
  <li>Making it satisfying comes down to chasing the feeling once you‚Äôre done the behaviour (which is instant) vs. chasing the result (which is delayed). Focusing on the latter decreases the likelihood of sticking with the habit.</li>
</ul>

              Testing the Lattice: The Talent Code and Culture Code
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The Talent Code and Culture Code are books written by Daniel Coyle.</p>

<p>The Talent Code is about how to train individuals to become great at what they do.
The Culture Code is about how to enable groups to do great things together.</p>

<p>While they are published separately, I‚Äôm examining them together for the purpose of the leadership lattice, a framework for learning and developing leadership skills.</p>

<p>The Talent Code has 3 key points (from <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com/the-talent-code-summary/">this summary</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>More myelin is how you hardwire skills into your body.</li>
    <li>Use deep practice to increase the myelin around your neural pathways.</li>
    <li>Chunk up what you‚Äôre practicing into its smallest units.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>These can benefit anyone who is seeking to improve their own performance, or the performance of any individuals they manage. The lessons from The Talent Code apply in the domain of self management and individuals.</p>

<p>The Culture Code also has 3 main points (from <a href="">this summary</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Build safety to make everyone feel comfortable in working together.</li>
    <li>Share vulnerability to show no one needs to be perfect.</li>
    <li>Establish purpose through a common goal and a clear path to get there.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This framework can be used to improve a team‚Äôs performance, so it belongs within the team / organization domain.</p>

<p>Both books provide a simple, easy to follow framework for improvement at an individual and team level. They are a good example of how the lattice helps to ‚Äòstitch‚Äô together learning from different sources.</p>

              Evolve or Die (Forbes Article Highlights)
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A recent <a href="fortune.com/longform/value-investing-warren-buffett-tech-stocks/">Forbes article</a> detailed how value investing is changing, and how Warren Buffett is changing his attitude towards technology stocks.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the article, and wanted to highlight some passages I found interesting.</p>

<p>On how value investing is changing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a deep and important debate going on in the investment community, one with profound repercussions for both professional money managers and their clients. Some believe that Buffett is right‚Äîthat we have become an asset-light economy and that value investors need to adapt to accommodate such changes.</p>

  <p>‚Ä¶The fact that these stocks often trade at above-¬≠market valuations‚Äîa factor that once scared away orthodox value investors‚Äîhasn‚Äôt deterred them, because the companies‚Äô futures are so bright that they‚Äôre worth it.</p>

  <p>All value investors continue to agree that price is an important component of value‚Äîthat‚Äôs why we‚Äôre called value investors. What‚Äôs happening now is a debate about what the drivers of value are‚Äîof what constitutes value in the 21st-century economy‚Äîand what will drive both the economy and the market forward over the next generation.</p>

  <p>This explains why for decades Buffett avoided technology stocks. There was growth in tech, for sure, but there was little certainty. Things changed too quickly; every boom was accompanied by a bust. In the midst of such flux, who could find a high-probability insight?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the changing nature of what it means to be a valuable company:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the Dow Jones industrial average was still dominated by industrials, it also contained Procter &amp; Gamble, Sears Roebuck, and General Foods. These companies were fundamentally different from an industrial company: The primary driver of their business value had little to do with hard assets. Rather, the value had to do with the company‚Äôs brands‚Äîwith the loyalty and familiarity that customers felt for Ivory Soap and Jell-O gelatin. These emotional ties, encouraged and cemented by mass marketing, allowed businesses to charge high prices for relatively mundane goods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the role Television played in driving growth for this new crop of companies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great enabler of such businesses was the rise of national television, which both emanated from and reinforced a culture of homogeneity. Market-leading brands used scale in a very different but no less effective way than manufacturing companies. A beer, shampoo, or cola brand with dominant share could flood the three major TV networks with more advertising than their competition, yet still spend less than the competition as a percentage of absolute sales dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The parallels to the Internet and Smartphones is uncanny.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of value investing are the same in an era of technology dominance. Some tenets are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always look for a business with a clear-cut competitive advantage. If you can‚Äôt explain to your spouse what makes a company special as a long-term moneymaker, it probably isn‚Äôt.</p>

  <p>Try to find companies with a small market share, a huge addressable market, and a large competitive advantage.</p>

  <p>As Buffett has said, never confuse a growing industry with a profitable one.</p>

  <p>Avoid businesses whose best days are behind them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Value 2.0 and 3.0:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Value 2.0: finding a superior business and paying a reasonable price for it. The margin of safety lies not in the tangible assets but rather in the sustainability of the business itself.</p>

  <p>Value 3.0: ‚Ä¶digital businesses often benefit from network effects: the tendency of consumers to standardize on a single platform, which reinforces both consumer preference and the platform‚Äôs value. Because of this, the market shares of these platform companies dwarf those of the consumer products giants; software businesses like these are often characterized by a ‚Äúwinner take all‚Äù or ‚Äúwinner take most‚Äù dynamic. Combine this with the fact that they require little to no capital to grow, and you have Value 3.0‚Äîbusiness ¬≠models that are both radically new and enormously valuable.</p>

  <p>If the postwar era was about consumer brands operating at scale, the early 21st century is about what we might call digital platforms. Like the branded enterprises before them, they have the permanence and probability that make for a good long-term value investment.</p>

  <p>As these platform companies create billions in value, they are simultaneously undermining the postwar ecosystem that Buffett has understood and profited from. Entire swaths of the economy are now at risk, and investors would do well not only to consider Value 3.0 prospectively but also to give some thought to what might be vulnerable in their Value 2.0 portfolios.</p>

              Uncertainty
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>These are unstable times.</p>

<p>Socially, economically, environmentally - it all feels like the last few decades of progress are somewhat unravelling. Some of it has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_exuberance">irrational exuberance</a>, but many of these changes will need to be undone. That will take time.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs interesting to work in technology at this time. We have our heads firmly planted in the future, but now more than ever - we have no clue what that future might be.</p>

<p>Even a 5 year outlook seems full of uncertainty.</p>

<p>As the year ends and I think ahead about 2019, a few disconnected thoughts are going through my mind.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôm strangely optimistic. Uncertainty and risk are often times of opportunity - especially for the world of tech. Some giants are stumbling and it may create space for more to emerge.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm worried about the state of globalism and nationalism. The policies are easily reversible, the mindsets are not. This may be the defining struggle of our generation.</li>
  <li>History has the answers. There are plenty of things that are different, but times like these makes me more interested in what has happened decades and centuries ago during times of change. The past can provide more insight in these times.</li>
  <li>Have a plan. It‚Äôs important to chart your course and follow it. That plan will give you comfort when waters are choppy.</li>
  <li>Change will happen slowly, and then suddenly. Most of the changes (if negative) will be tolerable as they happen. As they compound, we‚Äôll reach a tipping point and shit will hit the fan, so to speak. Know this is happening. Be prepared.</li>
  <li>Things are going to get worse before they get better. We‚Äôre already dangerously close (if not past) to the path of no return for some things - especially environmentally.</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure which one of these is most important. Perhaps it‚Äôs that uncertainty is now the new reality, and it‚Äôs here to stay.</p>

              Ending a Paternity Leave: Some Early Reflections
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôm ending a paternity leave soon and made my way back into the office today. I‚Äôm going to write more on this topic soon, but putting some rough thoughts together.</p>

<ul>
  <li>More dads should do this. Sure, my situation was different with twins, and not everyone <em>can</em> do it. But for those that have the means - I‚Äôd recommend it.</li>
  <li>You‚Äôll learn more about yourself than you could have imagined.</li>
  <li>Parenting is a forcing function to reset your habits. Every minute of your day will be reevaluated. You can choose to let this run you over, or use it in your favor and develop better, healthier habits.</li>
  <li>Take all the help you can get. We have twin daughters, so this is more important to us.</li>
  <li>Turn off. Make home your job. Approach it with the same rigor you would approach work.</li>
  <li>Ease back in. Going from not working to working 5 days a week is a recipe for disaster.</li>
  <li>Take more video. Your babies will not make the same sounds growing up. Pictures won‚Äôt cut it.</li>
</ul>

<p>That‚Äôs all for now, but I‚Äôll come back to this topic later.</p>

              The Power of Cues
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been reading <a href="www.atomichabits.com">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear. It outlines a framework for forming and keeping habits (good and bad), and it starts by understanding the cues that precede so much of our actions.</p>

<p>A cue can be a time, location, preceding event or emotional state. He provides a simple example - how placing a book on your pillow can encourage you to read everytime you come back to bed.</p>

<p>I tried it out, and it works well. I am now reading more regularly every night, and I find myself falling asleep reading my Kindle. While I only get through a few pages before getting drowsy, it beats staying awake staring at my phone watching Netflix or scrolling through the news.</p>

<p>Once you start using cues, I find myself more present and noticing them throughout the day. It‚Äôs a small but powerful change in my daily routines.</p>

<p>Other parts of the framework are cravings, responses and rewards. I‚Äôm only half way through Atomic Habits, but it‚Äôs a great so far and have already recommended it to friends and family.</p>

              Are Banks the new &#39;Dumb Pipes&#39;?
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>After the recent announcement by <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/robinhood-checking-savings">Robinhood</a>, I‚Äôve read numerous <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/backus/status/1073636671227256832">discussion</a> about Fintech - more specifically that every Fintech startup wants to grow up to become a bank (i.e. own the customer relationship).</p>

<p>This sounds like <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">aggregation theory</a> at work - the defining playbook of the Internet era. First, own the customer relationship, and then use that to exercise leverage on suppliers.</p>

<p>For example - Netflix spent years building a customer relationship, developing a streaming entertainment habit and licensing content from studios. Netflix Originals helped them move up the value chain - it gave them full ownership and control over what was produced and how it was produced. With their distribution power, Originals gave them full control of content.</p>

<p>Probably more relevant though is the comparison to cellphone networks before the iPhone launched in 2007. At that time, network providers had full control of the voice, messaging and [most importantly] data products. With the iPhone and AppStore, the network as the provider of content quickly became irrelevant. The network became a ‚Äúdumb pipe‚Äù, and all the value for the smartphone shifted to the device manufacturers because they had a stronger relationship to end consumers. People bought an iPhone or Android, and stopped talking about whether they were on AT&amp;T, Verizon or T-Mobile.</p>

<p>A similar shift is in progress in the world of finance. Startups are providing consumers a number of banking services - attacking gaps in user experience, unfriendly pricing and general opacity in the world of banking. By building customer relationships, these companies can expand in the value chain to offer more services that banks currently offer.</p>

<p>This probably doesn‚Äôt mean a full disruption of banks, but a lot of the value sits above the core banking services (infrastructure, underwriting risk, and securitization). By losing the customer relationship through consumer financial products like checking, savings, investments, and loans - banks risk becoming the dumb pipes of the finance industry.</p>

              Yield Curve Rates from 1992-2018
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A few weeks ago the <a href="/20181203/us-yield-curve-inverted.html">US Treasury Bond yield curve inverted</a>. Yesterday I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/vader7x/status/1072345740385632256">this visualization</a> on Twitter recently that really illustrated the change well with historical context.</p>

<p>A positively sloping yield curve - or one where the long term rates are higher than short term - is correlated with a stronger economy. When companies are doing well, the yields on bonds (corresponding to debt issued to a company) are increased. When the opposite is true - when short term bonds pay the same yield, or higher yield than long term bonds - it is often correlated with a recession. Put another way - if you‚Äôre giving someone money for 10 years to invest, and they say they can‚Äôt make you any more than you‚Äôd get in 2 years - they probably believe something is wrong.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.learningmarkets.com/understanding-the-yield-curve/">Learning Markets</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A flat yield tells us that investors believe the Federal Reserve is going to be cutting interest rates. Typically, the Federal Reserve only has to cut interest rates when the economy is contracting and the Fed is trying to stimulate growth. Therefore, a flat yield curve is often a sign of an economic slowdown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a topic I‚Äôm learning a bit more about, and writing about it has helped me develop my understanding. Some of the resources I‚Äôve found helpful are the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp">Investopedia</a>, <a href="https://www.learningmarkets.com/understanding-the-yield-curve/">Learning Markets</a> and ofcourse, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_curve">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

              Some Thoughts on Inversion and Evergreen Strategy
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Strategy is the exercise of making decisions to drive business direction. Strategy is about choice - what you‚Äôre doing, and more importantly, what you‚Äôre not doing.</p>

<p>Most strategy starts with a variation of a simple question - how can we win? What can we do that will help us capture a market or increase our profits?</p>

<p>From that starting point - Markets are mapped, choices are enumerated, and decision making frameworks are put to work. Popular stories of strategy are about businesses taking big risks, employing some unique leverage, or hacking their way to success.</p>

<p>But what if we turned the process around? What if, instead of thinking <em>forward</em> - developing strategy to help us win - we thought <em>backwards</em> - and focused on strategy that just prevents us from losing.</p>

<p>In other words, what happens when <a href="/20181001/decision-making-frameworks.html"><em>inversion</em></a> is the driving force behind strategic planning?</p>

<p>I think what you end up with is a land of <em>evergreen strategy</em> - strategy that is quite simply never wrong. The closest example to this is Amazon‚Äôs focus on low prices and vast selection. One of the most quoted Jeff Bezos</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I very frequently get the question: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to change in the next 10 years?‚Äù And that is a very interesting question; it‚Äôs a very common one. I almost never get the question: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs not going to change in the next 10 years?‚Äù And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two ‚Äì because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. ‚Ä¶ [I]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that‚Äôs going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, ‚ÄúJeff, I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love Amazon; I just wish you‚Äôd deliver a little more slowly.‚Äù Impossible.</p>

  <p>And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In technology, we can fall victim to building new things for a changing landscape. And the allure of <em>new</em> drives tech journalism. This is the world of forward-looking strategy. Ofcourse, it‚Äôs not without merit - there are many examples of this success.</p>

<p>But the <a href="https://andrewchen.co/the-next-feature-fallacy-the-fallacy-that-the-next-new-feature-will-suddenly-make-people-use-your-product/">next feature fallacy</a> is real. As product builders on the constant search for delightful and engaged users, maybe we should just stop and ask - what won‚Äôt piss our users off?</p>

<p>And then go build it.</p>

              Company Stage and the Leadership Lattice
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The leadership lattice is a learning framework, focused on management and leadership. The framework is a simplified conceptual structure of how companies work - and takes inspiration from the world of systems thinking. It‚Äôs a set of interconnected domains of responsibility - put together, they can describe everything your company does from individual to impact.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been testing how well it works as a learning framework by taking lessons from the most popular leadership books and checking how they <em>fit</em> into the lattice. In theory, the lattice is the skeleton and the books provide the ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù through specific management practices.</p>

<p>Two books in particular - Lean Startup and Zero to One - provide leadership and management practices for early stage startups. Both these books revealed that the lattice is incomplete because it doesn‚Äôt have a concept of time. Your leadership lattice (and associated practices) should and will evolve as your company grows in size.</p>

<p>So, I wanted to add the concept of <strong>Stage</strong> as a property of each domain across the lattice. Different stages require different practices and that needs to be reflected in the lattice. The good thing is - the domains themselves (i.e the conceptual strucutre of how companies work) is largely unchanged, no matter what the stage - every stage will have domains for individuals, teams, application, and so on.</p>

<p>Note that the lattice was also extended recently through the addition of the <a href="/20181206/extending-the-lattice.html">peer and governance domain</a>.</p>

              <p>VisaList is a new app that was featured on ProductHunt yesterday. It‚Äôs a simple app - a user enters their country of citizenship, and then are shown all the countries where they can travel with a visa, a special permit, or without any visa.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a deceptively simple app, but can easily be extended to become the first place where travel plans start. Most often, travel plans take visa requirements for granted.</p>

<p>It can also be extended beyond travel visas to work and education visas, and serve a starting point for larger migration decisions that hinge on visa requirements.</p>

<p>Having travelled all my life, I‚Äôm way too familiar with visa rules across the world - whether they are related to travel, study, work or immigration. Something like VisaList can become starting point to a very underserved market.</p>

              Testing the Lattice: Zero to One
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This post references the book summary provided in <a href="https://medium.com/@paulmillr/zero-to-one-summary-8dbda22e1559">this medium post</a>.</p>

<p>Zero to One by Peter Thiel is the seminal guide to the earliest stages of a startup‚Äôs life.</p>

<p>Peter Thiel is not without controversy, and I don‚Äôt agree with the entire book. However, this exercise is about testing the Leadership Lattice as a learning framework, to evaluate if lessons from popular leadership books can be connected with the lattice.</p>

<p>Some key concepts from Zero to One:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anti-Incrementalism - an approach that focuses on bold approaches vs. lean startup approaches. This is an approach to building products within the application domain.</li>
  <li>Avoiding Competition - Again, an approach to finding markets, also within the application domain.</li>
  <li>Building a Monopoly - A formula for durable businesses, an excellent set of lessons within the application domain to guide product development.</li>
  <li>Recruiting - Some practical tips for recruiting employees based on vision and long term company mission. This applies to the Individual and Organization domain.</li>
  <li>The Importance of Sales - Most startups underemphasize sales and distribution. Again, lessons that belong in the application domain.</li>
  <li>Seven Questions Every Startup Should Answer - A set of criteria to create durable technology businesses (application domain)</li>
  <li>Tech Companies are Monarchies - An argument for feudal structures in startups, which is an approach to organizational design (team domain).</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, Zero to One focuses on the application domain, and has some lessons for the Team and Individual domains. However, since it‚Äôs a manual for the early stages in a startup - where the only thing that matters is Product/Market fit - this is not too surprising.</p>

<p>As a learning framework, the lattice can contain most, if not all, the concepts explored in Zero to One. However, it challenges the structure because it‚Äôs not about leadership in all contexts - only in the early stages of a company. Since leadership approaches need to develop as the company evolves, the lattice needs to have this temporal dimension added too. Zero to One and Lean Startup, both of which focus on early stages of startups, emphasize this need.</p>

              <p>DISCLAIMER: I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor. I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.</p>

<p>Some notes from a conversation with a relative and informal financial advisor, on the topic of investing in bear markets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Markets move in cycles. For the last 10 years we‚Äôve been in the longest period of growth. A downturn is expected, healthy and necessary. We don‚Äôt know when it will happen or how long it will last.</li>
  <li>No one can predict the future and we shouldn‚Äôt try to market time investments.</li>
  <li>The typical bear market averages about 18 months. While you cannot predict the bottom (see previous point), timing an entry into the market should probably weight towards the end of that cycle.</li>
  <li>That weighting shouldn‚Äôt be 100% at the expected end of the cycle, but spread throughout that time. It‚Äôs important to be consistent and have a plan for re-entry.</li>
  <li>All of this is investments for the long term. Even if the bear market lasts longer than 18 months, it will be a blip in the chart when looking over 20-30 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these are obvious investment principles. But especially in a bear market when emotions run high - it‚Äôs important to remember the basics, have a plan and stick to it.</p>

              <p>‚ÄúDo things and tell people‚Äù is probably one of my favorite pieces of advice. It‚Äôs simple, yet extremely effective. There are countless examples of success that started with people <em>consistently</em> producing things - building software, designing, writing - and <em>consistently</em> putting their work out there for people to enjoy.</p>

<p>By themselves - any one of those two things - doing things and telling people - have limited value.</p>

<p>Working on things without telling anyone can be satisfying for a little while, but over time the lack of feedback will often bring creativity to a halt. As they say - it‚Äôs not really a joke until someone laughs at it. I find myself falling into this trap often. This blog itself is an exercise to get over some of those insecurities.</p>

<p>Obviously, telling people without doing anything is just noise. It can be <em>somewhat</em> useful, but it doesn‚Äôt have much lasting value. It‚Äôs surprising how much of this exists.</p>

<p>Putting them together consistently over time is a formula for compounding impact, and can build a path to success, no matter what you do.</p>

              Extending the Lattice: Peer and Governance Domains
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The leadership lattice is a framework I‚Äôve developed over time for developing leadership skills, and written about frequently.</p>

<p>From <a href="/20181020/leadership-lattice-simplified.html">Leaderhip Lattice, Simplified</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The concept of building a latticework is a general learning technique - instead of trying to learn things in isolation, we should attempt to hang them onto a latticework of theory that helps to connect it all together.</p>

  <p>In the context of leadership, the latticework is a simple conceptual structure of how companies work. I will also caveat this is about leadership in a private enterprise vs government.</p>

  <p>So, the lattice is simply a breakdown of this into interconnected components that need to be managed: the leader, individuals, systems of organization (teams), the products and services offered in market, and the collective impact of the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In any company, there is also a directionality to management. We manage our teams, but we also manage upwards (our bosses, investors and boards) and sideways (peers, leadership teams). The lattice doesn‚Äôt encompass that type of ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù, but it is absolutely essential in getting towards the impact we‚Äôre looking to make.</p>

<p>So, it makes sense to extend the lattice by adding the notion of directionality into it, and adding two additional domains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peer Domain: Concerned with managing sideways - your peer group and teammates. This domain is primarily about building stronger relationships with peers, and building cohesion across teams (also somewhat covered in the team domain).</li>
  <li>Governance Domain: Concerned with managing upwards - your own manager, investors, board. This includes activities such topics as managing expectations and fundraising.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this addition, the lattice covers management and leadership in multiple directions, and is a more complete framework.</p>

<p>In future ‚ÄúTesting the Lattice‚Äù series, I‚Äôll be looking for lessons in leadership books that are relevant to these domains.</p>

              Testing the Lattice: Lean Startup
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Few books have enjoyed the popularity within the startup community that Lean Startup has. It‚Äôs provided a framework to solving business problems that emphasizes customer feedback, small teams, quick decision cycles and democratization of ideas. It‚Äôs still widely used today and there are thousands of startups that continue to employ it‚Äôs methodology.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a leadership book, but it‚Äôs also a very practical operating manual. Lean Startup is divided into 3 sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vision: Dedicated to the process of decision making around a specific idea - vision setting, defining, learning and experimenting.</li>
  <li>Steer: Focused on what needs to happen when a product is in market - testing, measuring, pivoting or persevering.</li>
  <li>Accelerate: Focused on what happens after product market fit is achieved - growing, adapting and innovating in a competitive market. There is also a chapter in this section dedicated to working in ‚Äòsmall batches‚Äô - the idea of conducting short experiments and iterating quickly.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Lean Startup is almost entirely focused on the realm of application - specifically around the areas of product development and the early stages of a product and company lifecycle. There is some advice that can be applied in the organization domain, specifically around team size and the processes to stay agile.</p>

<p>The Lean Startup is less of a book about leadership than it is about a specific approach to product development. However, the leadership lattice still serves as a good framework for fitting lessons from the book. As such, Lean Startup is another good example that supports the Lattice as a learning framework.</p>

            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Effective Executive by Peter Drucker is a leadership classic. Drucker‚Äôs work has served as the foundation of modern business principles, and Effective Executive is one of his seminal books.</p>

<p>The book focuses on a few key ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Effectiveness can be learnt - it is a tool for managing oneself.</li>
  <li>Know where your time goes. Actively manage, measure and make modifications to get the most of your day. This applies to yourself, individuals you manage and teams.</li>
  <li>An executive is always focused on their own and their teams contributions</li>
  <li>An executive is always building on strengths vs weakness</li>
  <li>An executive is always focused on concentration through prioritization</li>
  <li>Effective executives need to know how to make good decisions</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the concepts in the book are centered in the domain of self management. The central premise of the book is that effectiveness is the art of managing oneself. The notion of tracking and managing time, a central technique explored in the book, is an excellent productivity tool.</p>

<p>However, many concepts also apply to the individual and team domains. The sections on contribution, strengths and concentration - all have lessons for managing individuals and creating organizational flow. There is a significant focus in managing teams time and running effective meetings.</p>

<p>The lessons from Effective Executive fit well in the structure of the <a href="/20180905/leadership-lattice.html">lattice</a>, and reinforce the lattice as a useful framework for learning about leadership and management.</p>

              <p>Start with Why is a book by Simon Sinek, published in 2009. There‚Äôs also an excellent <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en">TED Talk</a> on the subject of the book. It is centered around the concept of ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù - the central reason that inspires action in people.</p>

<p>Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Action, is divided into 4 parts:</p>

<p>1) About Why - An overview of ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù and it‚Äôs role in decision making
2) Brands - How ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù plays a key role is helping to shape the long-term success of brands - Lessons from here apply in the Application domain.
3) Organizations - How ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù plays a role in attracting and retaining employees - Lessons from this section apply mostly in the Individual domain, but some also in the domain of Organization.
4) Personal leadership - How ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù plays a role in leadership - This is primarily concerned with how leaders use Why as a tool to inspire and lead - and can be considered part of the Individual or Organization domain.</p>

<p>As a leadership book, Start with Why touches many parts of the lattice, and is one of the few books that bridges between the domain of Individual, Organization <em>and</em> Application / . The lessons test the structure of the lattice, and it‚Äôs an interesting leadership book structured entirely around the concept of why, rather than a specific leadership technique or management approach.</p>

              <p>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team is a book by Patrick Lencioni, first published in 2002. It was a best seller when it was released as is considered a staple of management books.</p>

<p>The lessons from the book fall squarely in the organizational domain of the Leadership Lattice. It focuses on the 5 things that lead to teams not working well together. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absence of trust‚Äîunwilling to be vulnerable within the group</li>
  <li>Fear of conflict‚Äîseeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate</li>
  <li>Lack of commitment‚Äîfeigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization</li>
  <li>Avoidance of accountability‚Äîducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards</li>
  <li>Inattention to results‚Äîfocusing on personal success, status and ego before team success</li>
</ul>

<p>The lessons from Five Dysfunctions do fit within the framework of the leadership lattice, reinforcing it as a learning framework for management and leadership.</p>

              The Future of Service Marketplaces
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Andrew Chen wrote an excellent <a href="https://andrewchen.co/how-marketplaces-will-reinvent-the-service-economy/">article</a> about the different stages of services marketplaces, with a hypothesis on what is next.</p>

<ul>
  <li>He discusses the different stages of services marketplaces, and how they moved from simple listings services (solving the discovery problem) to taking over more parts of the service. Recent examples of marketplaces are more vertically integrated - they provide discovery, booking, hire the providers and ensure quality of service.</li>
  <li>He talks about the future of services marketplaces being in the area of regulated services - where service providers are licensed or certified, by a government agency or industry organization. Regulated services include healthcare practitioners, food service operators, engineers and architects, and many more. There are over 125 million regulated service workers, so there is a large supply opportunity.</li>
  <li>He discusses the unique challenges to unlock the next wave of opportunity for service marketplaces.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last twenty years saw the explosion of a number of services coming online, from transportation to food delivery to home services, as well as an evolution of marketplace models from listings to full-stack, managed marketplaces. The next twenty years will be about the harder opportunities that software hasn‚Äôt yet infiltrated‚Äìthose filled with technological, operational, and regulatory hurdles‚Äìwhere there is room to have massive impact on the quality and convenience of consumers‚Äô everyday lives.</p>

              <p>Today I spent the afternoon watching the Mars Insight mission land on Mars. I wondered what space travel was going to look like when my daughters are my age, and whether we‚Äôd see a man or woman on Mars by then.</p>

              Testing the Lattice: Radical Candor
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Radical Candor is a book by Kim Scott. It‚Äôs recent but has been very well received and I thought I‚Äôd analyse it for how well it fits within the leadership lattice.</p>

<p>At the core of Radical Candor is the notion that an effective manager and leader is both blunt and empathetic at the same time.</p>

<p>The lessons from Radical Candor sit mostly within the Individual domain, and some specific to team cohesion in the Organization domain.</p>

<p>Lessons from the individual domain are mostly concerned with how a manager can establish a more meaningful relationship with employees.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two principles are involved in Radical Candor: a manager should care about their employees, and at the same time: challenge them to do the best work possible.</li>
  <li>Guidance, team, and results: these are the responsibilities of any boss. This is equally true for anyone who manages people‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCEOs, middle managers, and first-time leaders</li>
  <li>As a manager you have fulfill your three responsibilities:
    <ol>
      <li>to create a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that will keep everyone moving in the right direction</li>
      <li>to understand what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredom and keep the team cohesive</li>
      <li>to drive results collaboratively</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The Getting Stuff Done framework is a flywheel of team execution that produces superior results</li>
</ul>

<p>Lessons from the Organization domain are concerned with team cohesion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To keep a team cohesive, you need both rock stars and superstars</li>
  <li>Sometimes creating a culture of listening is simply a matter of managing meetings the right way.</li>
  <li>Part of your job as the boss is to help people think through their ideas before submitting them to the rough-and-tumble of debate</li>
  <li>There are times when people are just too tired, burnt out, or emotionally charged up to engage in productive debate. It‚Äôs crucial to be aware of these moments, because they rarely lead to good outcomes. Your job is to intervene and call a time-out</li>
  <li>Set a ‚Äúdecide by‚Äù date, so everybody would know that they couldn‚Äôt lobby the project manager endlessly</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some lessons related to the Self domain, related to productivity and time management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Often, execution is a solitary task. We use calendars mostly for collaborative tasks‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto schedule meetings, etc. One of your jobs as a manager is to make sure that collaborative tasks don‚Äôt consume so much of your time or your team‚Äôs time that there‚Äôs no time to execute whatever plan has been decided on and accepted</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes from this post are from the excellent <a href="https://hackernoon.com/notes-from-radical-candor-kim-scott-b663c019d025">summary</a> of Radical Candor by Manas Saloi.</p>

              The Fragmented Home
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Cyber Monday is tomorrow and I‚Äôm using it as an opportunity to stock up on the latest in smart home appliances. I‚Äôm in the market for smart lights, cameras and door locks.</p>

<p>The market is fragmented into 3 ecosystems - Alexa, Google Home and Apple Homekit. Each one serves as the hub of your smart home. This post is a quick review of all three.</p>

<p>Amazon Alexa is the most mature platform here. The Echo series of devices is now in it‚Äôs 3rd generation and is well supported by all smart home appliances, ofcourse very well tied into Amazon Prime. Alexa‚Äôs user interface could use some work - invoking skills is still a bit clunky and the app needs a design refresh. I‚Äôm also not a huge fan of the Echo Show, the smart home hub display.</p>

<p>Google Home is in close second here. Almost every device supports Google, and it has the natural advantage of knowing me through my Google account. Integration with Google photos, news preferences - all of these just work. The <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_hub?hl=en-US">Google Home hub</a> is a $99 device and ties in nicely to Nest as well. It is a newer platform and some of the hardware is still first and second gen, so I‚Äôm hesitant to buy.</p>

<p>Apple Homekit seems to be the newer entrant and has the advantage of tight integration into iOS, which means no additional hardware is required. I can ofcourse buy the Homepod. I‚Äôm also an Apple TV user so it would be an easy extension to the ecosystem. I‚Äôm not quite sure how well supported it is across smart devices, but likely not as much as Alexa.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm leaning towards Amazon Alexa because of platform maturity - I don‚Äôt want my smart home to be finicky with new hardware issues. This also reminds me of the PC vs Mac debate - it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had to make a platform choice as binary as this.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll post updates to my setup once it‚Äôs all done.</p>

              The Resilience of Costco
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>An excellent fundamental analysis of the Costco business. It details the Costco business model and flywheel - how low prices leads to more memberships, more sales and leverage with suppliers -  thereby leading to even lower prices. It also talks about their operating approach - from how they select what inventory to sell to how they treat employees - and how it‚Äôs all designed to serve the customer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 40 years, Costco has succeeded with a simple formula: reinvest merchandising profits into lower prices and better products; be a disciplined operator; and treat customers and employees well. But with greater share of shopping moving online, it‚Äôs fair to wonder if the company‚Äôs best days are behind it. The deck below will explore this in detail.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Social media has many benefits, but our feeds are consumed by the best of other people‚Äôs work. No one, understanably so, is publishing their failures. It can be inspiring to some, but the incessant stream is mostly just a distraction from the real work.</p>

<p>It can quickly become a competition - something that quickly consumes our attention, creating perverse incentives and distracting us from the real work. At it‚Äôs worst, it can be the source of real mental anguish.</p>

<p>The real work is the work we do for our customers. This is the work of our livelihoods, the ups and downs of which are not broadcast for everyone to see.</p>

<p>The real work is the work we do to improve ourselves daily. This is the work we do to improve how we are investing our own time and attention. No one sees this but ourselves.</p>

<p>The real work doesn‚Äôt get talked about, but it‚Äôs the only one that matters.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The CIA has an excellent online library (just found this out), and saw an incredible book called <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis">The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis</a>, which is a study of how we think.</p>

<p>It deals with the limitations of how we think, and how to overcome some of those limitations.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it uses the language of mental models frequently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Herbert Simon first advanced the concept of ‚Äúbounded‚Äù or limited rationality. Because of limits in human mental capacity, he argued, the mind cannot cope directly with the complexity of the world. Rather, we construct a simplified mental model of reality and then work with this model. We behave rationally within the confines of our mental model, but this model is not always well adapted to the requirements of the real world. The concept of bounded rationality has come to be recognized widely, though not universally, both as an accurate portrayal of human judgment and choice and as a sensible adjustment to the limitations inherent in how the human mind functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs a great resource and I‚Äôll probably be referring back to it often.</p>

              Testing the Lattice: Good to Great
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Good to Great, published in 2001 by Jim Collins is a leadership classic. It describes the few factors that help a company go from, well, good to great.</p>

<p>The book focuses on ideas across the lattice- from managing one self as a leader to confronting brutal facts about the reality of business environments. I‚Äôve used the book summary provided <a href="http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Good_to_Great:_Why_Some_Companies_Make_the_Leap..._and_Others_Don%27t">here</a> to help outline some of the key concepts from the book.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 5 leadership is the art of showing determinism and humility - something that shows up when managing one self and also managing individuals and teams</li>
  <li>The notion of ‚ÄúWho, then What‚Äù is an underlying approach - it‚Äôs a recognition that people and teams are the highest point of leverage for management. In leadership lattice, it‚Äôs a recognition that most of the work is done in the domains of individuals and teams.</li>
  <li>Confronting the Brutal Facts is an idea best applied in the application domain - it‚Äôs important to create a culture in which the truth of the business environment is shared - good and bad - to help people make the best possible decisions.</li>
  <li>The Hedgehog Concept - the ability to be the best at <em>something</em> - is applied in the application domain as well, although it doesn‚Äôt really fit neatly in the lattice.</li>
  <li>The culture of discipline / determination is fostered in people and teams to help achieve the outcomes in the application domain.</li>
  <li>Technology accelerators is an interesting concept not covered in many leadership books. It talks about how companies approach new technology. This is a lesson from the application domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, Good to Great fits within the lattice but it is primarily a book about company building with some leadership lessons peppered throughout.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>It‚Äôs often said that ‚ÄúCulture eats Strategy for breakfast.‚Äù</p>

<p>I was thinking about this phrase today, and what it really means.</p>

<p>Strategy is about navigating a specific market landscape. Culture is building an organization that can navigate any changing landscape.</p>

<p>Strategy is about understanding your market and  competitors. Culture is about focusing on your customers and above everyone else.</p>

<p>Strategy is making the right choice at the right time, culture is building an organization that knows how to make good choices and learns from them.</p>

<p>In essence, good strategy is the application of culture. Good culture creates good strategy; the reverse is not true.</p>

<p>I like the phrase but I don‚Äôt like how it can be misinterpreted.</p>

              <p>I saw this phrase on Twitter today - it was a quote from Sheetal Jaitly, CEO of TribalScale, an innovation consulting firm in Toronto. I think he was referring to most companies‚Äô innovation labs and hackathons - which are simply theatrics that serve no real purpose other than to make leaders <em>feel</em> like they‚Äôre 
innovating.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that <strong>innovation teams should aim to not exist</strong>. Essentially, they should aim to lose the ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù prefix. In order for an innovation team to succeed, they have to graduate to being a part of the business. True innovation teams become business lines that create new customers and value networks.</p>

<p>After all, innovation teams inherently have a limited life span - if they cannot prove their value within the cadence of a strategic planning cycle, they will often cease to exist anyways - but for the wrong reason.</p>

<p>True innovation teams create real business value. Everything else is just innovation theater.</p>

This and other studies like it are pointing to the same conclusion - that our obsession with driving engagement has a negative impact on our collective mental health. This is a problem created by the tech industry, and something the industry has to take responsibility to fix.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a week of baseline monitoring, 143 undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania were randomly assigned to either limit Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat use to 10 minutes, per platform, per day, or to use social media as usual for three weeks. <strong>Results:</strong> The limited use group showed significant reductions in loneliness and depression over three weeks compared to the control group. Both groups showed significant decreases in anxiety and fear of missing out over baseline, suggesting a benefit of increased self-monitoring.</p>

              <p>Probably the most popular startup book in recent history, The Hard Thing about Hard Things was written by Ben Horowitz and contains stories and lessons from his many years leading software companies from Loudcloud to Netscape. The lessons contained in the book span all parts of the lattice.</p>

<p>The book focuses on managing yourself, managing people, and some very specific parts of the application domain. There‚Äôs a very specific tip to take care of <strong>people first, products next and then profits</strong>.</p>

<p>In the domain of managing self, the book talks about the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keeping a clear head, embracing the struggle of being an entrepreneur</li>
  <li>Enjoying the work</li>
  <li>Face the hard decisions head on</li>
</ul>

<p>The lessons about self management are some of the best parts of the book. From experience Ben talks about the struggles of being a CEO and how managing oneself is the first (and many times, most important) part of the job.</p>

<p>In the domain of managing individuals, the book talks about the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tell things like it is</li>
  <li>Rephrase the worst case scenario</li>
  <li>Some very specific hiring tips - like hiring for strength vs. lack of weakness,</li>
</ul>

<p>In the domain of managing teams, the book talks about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How large Organisations are slowed down by single people</li>
  <li>Minimise Politics by hiring for the right type of ambition, maintaining strict policy on org design, promoting based on performance, and ensuring 1:1‚Äôs are held. Ben is a subscriber to the Andy Grove school of thought so OKR‚Äôs make their way into The Hard Things as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the domain of products and markets, the Hard Thing speaks of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Good Product Managers vs. Bad Product Managers, a guide that continues to be relevant in the world of product management today.</li>
  <li>Wartime CEO (vs Peacetime CEO), a mode of operating (defined by competitive market position) that changes all the rules of operation</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hard Things doesn‚Äôt fit neatly in the lattice, but it does fit. All the lessons fall within one of the domains. It takes a very unique perspective and offers some real, raw leadership advice.</p>

              <p>This is post 75, and marks 75 consecutive days of blogging.</p>

<p>Some reflections on building this habit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mood changes really impact my will to write everyday. Some days all I can muster is an interesting link and some short commentary. You can‚Äôt even call that writing - it‚Äôs just a tweet.</li>
  <li>Related to above, fighting the urge to give up on those days is difficult, but it‚Äôs extremely satisfying to keep a streak going. The pull to maintain a streak is essential to habit forming.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve learned a lot about what I enjoy writing about, what comes naturally, and what takes a while but is really satisfying to complete. It‚Äôs taught me a little bit about myself.</li>
  <li>Consistent timing is essential. I‚Äôve settled into writing before bed, although I do want to experiment with early morning journaling and mid-day writing sessions too.</li>

              <p>An excellent post I discovered today from Our World in Data that really puts into context the history of the Internet - and how we are just getting started.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And while many of us cannot imagine their lives without the services that the internet provides, the key message for me from this overview of the global history of the internet is that we are still in the very early stages of the internet. It was only in 2017 that half of the world population was online; and in 2018 it is therefore still the case that close to half of the world population is not using the internet.5 The internet has already changed the world, but the big changes that the Internet will bring still lie ahead and its history has just begun.</p>

              Testing the Leadership Lattice: High Output Management
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>High Output Management is regarded as the management tome of the startup industry. Written by Andy Grove, the late co-founder and CEO of Intel, it describes a management framework that helped propel Intel to market dominance. The concepts in High Output Management are still actively practiced today.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found <a href="https://medium.com/@iantien/top-takeaways-from-andy-grove-s-high-output-management-2e0ecfb1ea63">this Medium article</a> to be an excellent summary of the core concepts of the book, although there‚Äôs no substitute for reading it fully.</p>

<p>The concepts in High Output Management mostly pertain to the the domains of managing individuals and managing teams. There are also some lessons on goal setting that apply within the application domain.</p>

<p>In the domain of managing individuals, the book talks about the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Managerial leverage dramatically impacts organizational output.</li>
  <li>Motivate employees by ‚Äúshaping the field‚Äù based on what drives them.</li>
  <li>Manage in the context of task-relevant maturity.</li>
  <li>Use performance reviews to improve performance.</li>
  <li>When an employee quits, it‚Äôs the manager‚Äôs fault.</li>
  <li>Recycle high achievers who are over-promoted.</li>
  <li>Training is the manager‚Äôs job.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the domain of managing teams, the book talks about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meetings are a medium of work.</li>
  <li>Decisions are the output of a process framed by six questions.</li>
  <li>As organizations grow speed decreases while leverage increases.</li>
  <li>Functional teams increase leverage, mission-oriented teams increase speed.</li>
  <li>Dual reporting increases both leverage and speed.</li>
  <li>Manage teams by setting expectations and cultural values.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the application domain, high output management covers a few key concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on vital, measurable indicators of output.</li>
  <li>Manage short-term objectives based on long-term plans.</li>
</ul>

<p>High Output Management is all signal - every chapter has a unique insight and there‚Äôs hardly any filler that dominates so much leadership writing.</p>

<p>It also fits well within the structure of the lattice. Most of the concepts cover the sections through which all managerial leverage is exercised - people and teams. This is highly appropriate for the book that introduced the concept of managerial leverage itself.</p>

              Testing The Lattice: The Fifth Discipline
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge is one of my favorite books on management, and happens to be renowned as one of the best leadership books out there. In it, Peter Senge outlines the five key elements of what makes a ‚Äúlearning organization‚Äù.</p>

<p>In it, there are five key elements: personal mastery, mental models, team learning, shared vision and systems thinking. It is a management framework that spans multiple parts of the leadership lattice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal mastery is about developing an inherent desire to make ourselves better</li>
  <li>Mental models are ofcourse the explanations of our thought processes</li>
  <li>Team learning is about the practices of dialog and discussion to acheive common objectives in a group</li>
  <li>Shared vision is the notion of carrying a shared understanding of what you‚Äôre trying to achieve</li>
  <li>Systems thinking is the underlying approach that puts it all togehter.</li>
</ul>

<p>These elements live across the lattice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal mastery is a function of self management (for leaders), and managing individuals</li>
  <li>Mental models and team learning are the domain of organization - both help to achieve organizational flow</li>
  <li>Shared vision lies in the domain of application and/or impact, as it helps to clarify the overall objectives that a team is trying to accomplish.</li>
  <li>Systems thinking is an approach that doesn‚Äôt live in any place within the lattice, but underlies the approach to constructing the lattice itself.</li>

              Order of Operations
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Order of operations is a simple concept - it emphasizes that outcomes depend on the sequence in which you do things. You cannot combine the same elements in a different order and expect the same output.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs one of the first concepts taught in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">elementary arithmetic</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also a mental model that has broad applications, especially in business. For example, the same product in the same market at two different times will have different consequences. Also, optimizing for product distribution before you have product-market fit can have disastrous consequences. The order in which you do things <em>matters</em> (a lot). It‚Äôs not enough just to have the right products in market - you have to build the right products for the right people at the right time.</p>

<p>Leveraging order of operations is the domain of good strategy. Applying the concept creates focus in a team, and it can make the difference between success and failure in products.</p>

              Developing a Writing Voice
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I was talking to a friend recently about writing, and I shared how I‚Äôm struggling with finding a writing voice. When I re-read my posts, the tone, tense and vocabulary feels a little foreign. Some of this may be because of the topics I‚Äôve chosen to explore or write about, but something just feels off.</p>

<p>The words don‚Äôt reflect me just yet, something that feels like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY">creative gap</a>.</p>

<p>He told me about the Welsh poet named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas">Dylan Thomas</a> and how he would write the same sentence fifty different ways until he found a style that worked for him. I wasn‚Äôt able to find any evidence of that but still feels like a worthwhile technique to try.</p>

<p>I decided to pick one sentence from my earlier posts and rewrite it until I became comfortable with it. I chose this sentence at random, from an earlier post entitled <a href="/20180902/self-curiosity.html">Self Curiosity</a>:</p>

<p>Original: I‚Äôve approached many self improvement challenges recently by starting with a practice of self curiosity before taking action or making a major decision on what to improve.</p>

<p>Rewrites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôm approaching new self improvement challenges by becoming curious about how I‚Äôm doing things today, before taking action or making a major decision on how to improve.</li>
  <li>Before I try any self improvement, I want to learn how I‚Äôm doing things today, so I can better understand what and how much I need to improve.</li>
  <li>Starting with curiosity helps to set a baseline for my current behavior, so I know exactly what and how much I need to improve.</li>
  <li>Getting better at something requires an understanding of what is happening today.</li>
  <li>The first step to self improvement is understanding. Trying to change a habit without knowing how much change is needed is a futile exercise.</li>
  <li>The first step to any self improvement is understanding yourself. Trying to make a change in your life without fully understanding how much change is needed leads to wasted effort.</li>
  <li>The first step to self improvement is understanding yourself. It reveals the extent of change needed, and helps you increase your chance of success.</li>
  <li>Self improvement often focuses on the new behavior that need to be adopted. But the most useful thing I‚Äôve done before trying to create new behaviors is first understanding myself.</li>
  <li>Step 1 of any self improvement practice has to be establishing a baseline of current behavior. It‚Äôs an easy first step that helps you understand the scope of change needed.</li>
  <li>Self improvement starts with introspection - understanding what you‚Äôre doing today, so you know what (and how much) you need to improve.</li>
  <li>I used to approach self improvement by immediately trying to change my behavior. Now, I start with introspection - understanding what I‚Äôm doing today. It requires almost no effort, and helps me understand where and how I need to improve.</li>
  <li>I now start any self improvement with introspection - an understanding of what I‚Äôm doing today. It takes little effort, and helps me understand how much I really need to improve.</li>

              Why I Write

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been having writer‚Äôs block this last week, and have often resorted to short posts, many simply linking to cool and useful resources. That‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not really why I started this blog. I thought I‚Äôd reaffirm <em>why I write</em> - primarily as a reminder for future reference. In itself, it‚Äôs helped unblock a few words and thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>I write to learn.</strong> I pick topics that I want to understand further, and force myself to write a post with some explanatory or analytical value. The exercise of both helps me understand a topic in more depth than reading.</p>

<p><strong>I write to clarify my methods.</strong> I write about certain mental models and frameworks, and writing about them helps to simplify my thinking. I also use these posts as reference for future use. The leadership lattice is one such example.</p>

<p><strong>I write as commentary on the future.</strong> Working in tech means your head is often planted in the future, for better or for worse. I write to clarify my hypotheses in that landscape of change.</p>

<p><strong>I write as a journal.</strong> I write to share experience and opinions. These are the unstructured stream of conciousness posts (a bit like this one).</p>

<p>Ultimately, all of my writing is self serving. I use it as a personal utility in many ways. In doing that, something may also be useful to others, and that‚Äôs cool too.</p>

              <p>I‚Äôve been writing about the leadership lattice for a while, and it‚Äôs mostly been in theory. I‚Äôm going to start putting it to the test by seeing how some of the top leadership resources fit into the lattice. If the lattice ‚Äúworks‚Äù, it should be expansive enough to hold management advice from a number of sources. I‚Äôm also hoping to see how it breaks and where it can be extended.</p>

              Peak Times
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôm a big believer in the power of peak times. Everyone has peak hours to do everything. I enjoy solitary work in the mornings, meetings in the afternoons, my writing habit has settled into the evening (after putting the kids to sleep), and I like to read before going to bed.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to fight those peak times - I‚Äôve tried to write in the mornings, and everything about the habit is more difficult. As James Clear says - ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems‚Äù. Our peak times are a part of our system.</p>

<p>So much of productivity is understanding your peak times for your tasks, and designing your day around it. You can always change your peak hours, but unless it‚Äôs really getting in the way of your day, just work with what works. Changing peak times takes some intentional conditioning and discipline.</p>

<p>This is especially true when you are just starting a habit - do whatever it takes to get you started, and once the habit is established, you can go about optimizing your day so that certain things fit better together.</p>

<p>This concept is amplified in a team - when a team working together doesn‚Äôt respect each other‚Äôs peak hours for productivity, interruptions can be particularly harmful. Most of the times, it‚Äôs because people simply don‚Äôt <em>know</em> each other‚Äôs peak times. It‚Äôs a simple exercise to make that available, and can be a huge boost to team productivity.</p>

              <p>I recently picked up <a href="http://www.atomichabits.com">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear. He has been writing an incredible blog for many years about the importance of habits and how to build them.</p>

<p>In this book, he details the four-step model of habits - cue, craving, response and reward - and the associated Four Laws of Behavioural Change that create habits.</p>

<p>According to Clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.</p>

<p>I just got started - It‚Äôs a great book already. I‚Äôll write a more detailed review in a future post (I don‚Äôt expect it will be too long from now).</p>

              <p>I recently found an incredible <a href="https://migrationdataportal.org/data">interactive map</a> that shows global trends in migration. For every country in the world, you can see it‚Äôs total immigrant population, % of immigrants to total population, and also the top 3 countries where migrants are coming from - among other information.</p>

<p>For instance, for Canada - we have 7.9M migrants (21% of our total population), and the top 3 countries are China, UK and India. 4.1M of these migrants is female. Canada also has the highest number of ‚Äúwork migrants‚Äù (as of 2016) - 69.7 thousand - even more than the United States for the same year.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates17.shtml">raw data</a> for much of this is made available by the UN.</p>

              The Leadership Lattice, Simplified
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve recently been writing about the Leadership Lattice - a framework for leadership development and learning. This post is an attempt to describe the lattice in the simplest possible terms.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of leadership advice these days - there are thousands of books, articles and podcasts. Taking it all in can be daunting, and applying it is even more difficult.</p>

<p>All too often, recency bias causes us to apply a technique that we have just read about. This is amplified in today‚Äôs startup ecosystem where advice is aplenty and context is minimal.</p>

<p>The concept of building a latticework is a general learning technique - instead of trying to learn things in isolation, we should attempt to hang them onto a latticework of theory that helps to connect it all together.</p>

<p>In the context of leadership, the latticework is a simple conceptual structure of how companies work. I will also caveat this is about leadership in a private enterprise vs government.</p>

<p>This conceptual structure starts with a simple description of <em>what a company is</em>: a collective of individuals in some commercial [or industrial] enterprise.</p>

<p>So, the lattice is simply a breakdown of this into interconnected components that need to be managed: the leader, individuals, systems of organization (teams), the products and services offered in market, and the collective impact of the company.</p>

<p>The lattice shows the range of accountability for a leader - they have to manage everything from themselves to the collective impact of their organization. Leaders choose to focus on areas depending on their areas of strength - some leaders often spend time in organizational systems, others in the application domain focused on products and markets.</p>

<p>The lattice is based on a first principles approach to leadership based on <em>how companies work</em> - and as such is just as much a framework of company building. As I mentioned in an <a href="/20181013/systems-of-impact.html">earlier post</a> - leadership development and company building are conceptually connected.</p>

<p>In future posts, I‚Äôll be <em>testing</em> the lattice with real advice - books and articles that I‚Äôve found helpful, and how they have helped to develop my own leadership lattice.</p>

              How Remote Work Creates Team Learning
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Recently, there‚Äôs been <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1053295266088927232">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1053064166825586689">discussion</a> in Tech Twitter about remote work.</p>

<p>This post is a commentary on how remote work creates a forcing function for knowledge management habits that enforces team learning.</p>

<p>Whether they are intentional about it or not, all individuals and teams are executing some form of <a href="/20181001/learning-loops.html">learning loop</a>. Teams <em>learn together</em> by sharing their experience, insights, knowledge and skills with each other about how to do things better. In order for teams to learn together, they execute a learning loop in a regular cadence - these can be multi week sprints, quarterly or even yearly planning cycles.</p>

<p>While colocated, a team‚Äôs learning habits can be easily neglected. Practices like capturing knowledge, documenting key decisions, and creating good onboarding practices all feel like makework. After all - when sharing experience and insights is a simple conversation away, any form of documentation feels like a burden.</p>

<p>However, when individuals are remote and especially across multiple time zones, this creates a forcing function that enforces better knowledge practices.</p>

<p>Knowledge capture becomes an essential to a team‚Äôs function - documenting key decisions and capturing meeting notes becomes necessary to ensure everyone, <em>everywhere</em> is working with consistent information.</p>

<p>Also, when they are continually referenced in future decisions, you can start to realize the benefits of compounded insights over time. For new members on a team or project, this provides invaluable context that can speed up a person‚Äôs onboarding experience.</p>

<p>For non-remote teams, approaching knowledge management as if you were a remote team may be the trick to unlock team learning in new ways.</p>

</a> by the NN Group so many times I‚Äôve lost count. It‚Äôs an incredible overview of the landscape of user research. While many tech startups still overlook the value of research, this has been changing as companies better understand the entirety of the design process.</p>

<p>I love these diagrams in particular, which highlight a framework to conduct research across 3 dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attitudinal (<em>why</em> questions) vs. Behavioural (<em>how</em> questions)</li>
  <li>Qualitative vs Quantitative</li>

              <p>I saw <a href="https://medium.com/@arjunsethi/how-to-transform-and-build-a-people-platform-2d981bfd720f">this great article</a> today from Arjun Sethi about how great companies are ‚Äúpeople platforms‚Äù.</p>

<p>The whole article is spot on, some choice quotes below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Companies that want to survive the next 10 years build software platforms. Companies that want to survive beyond that build people platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a company is racing toward product-market fit and trying to scale their product to thousands or even millions of users, it reaches a turning point. If it wants to compound growth, it needs to transition from a single product team to a people platform that can support multiple teams.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A people platform extends and amplifies the capabilities of team members the way a software platform extends and amplifies the capabilities of its products.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you‚Äôre building a platform for your team, you‚Äôre parsing out the core functions of your company into an extensible architecture. You‚Äôre growing an ecosystem around your company and making it more valuable than the sum of its parts. That enables new behaviors to emerge between your people that allow you to save time and adapt to change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept of a People Platform is very similar to a concept I explored few days ago in <a href="/20181013/systems-of-impact.html">Systems of Impact</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In essence - startups are <strong>systems of impact</strong> - they provide leverage to an individual‚Äôs contribution so they can create the biggest possible impact. Organizations that are successful are excellent levers - they grow individuals, they provide them with the opportunities to exercise that leverage, and part of that is building great products and distribution networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The companies that grow to be successful in the long term are those whose in which leaders focus on excellenace across <em>all</em> <a href="/20180905/leadership-lattice.html">domains of leadership</a>, and build an repeatable infrastructure to do so.</p>

              Better Digital Habits
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Our devices have become addiction machines, and my recent <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/">screen time</a> data prompted me to make some adjustments to my digital habits. I focused on changing how I use my phone - trying to reinforce <em>learning</em> in as many ways as possible, and wanted to share a few things I did.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using Twitter for Learning vs News - I‚Äôve always used Twitter as a tool for learning new about new topics. Reading conversations between the most knowledgeable people is a great way to learn about any subject matter. However, the news of the last few years has decreased the learning value of my feed. I recently changed who I follow, focusing less on news, and actively muted certain keywords to increase the educational value of my feed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changing my smartphone homescreen. I added <a href="/20180929/working-copy.html">Working Copy</a> and Wikipedia into my homescreen. I deleted Facebook and put all my social apps in a sub folder. I‚Äôve never really been active on social platforms, and I consume even less now that there‚Äôs extra friction associated with this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manual Time Tracking. I‚Äôve <a href="/20180918/time-tracking-update.html">written</a> about this habit before, and active tracking makes me constantly aware of where my time is being spent. This is more about personal reflection (learning about myself) rather than about any specific topic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are minor optimizations, but the benefits of these small changes will hopefully compound over time.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>There‚Äôs a new wave of software that is creating an unbundled rival to the trio of Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúG Suite‚Äù software - Docs, Sheets and Slides.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.airtable.com">Airtable</a> is building the new spreadsheet.<br />
<a href="http://www.notion.so">Notion</a> is building the new document / wiki.<br />
<a href="http://www.prezi.com">Prezi</a> is building the next generation presentation.<br />
<a href="http://www.realtimeboard.com">RealtimeBoard</a> is building a collaborative whiteboard.<br /></p>

<p>Some common properties of these apps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web and Mobile Native</strong> - These apps are the web and mobile native version of documents and spreadsheets - they do not assume a world in which word, excel or any other non-web document existed prior. There is no model of files in any of these products. Google Docs retains that model, and is simply the Microsoft office suite brought online (and hasn‚Äôt changed much since then).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interactive Widgets in Documents</strong> - Documents in these new apps have rich interactive  widgets. They are not bound by any model of what a document should look like. If you want to add a web embed in a spreadsheet cell, go for it. Need a Kanban board inside your document - not a problem. Widgets also open the door to great integrations with other web apps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Linking Documents Together</strong> - Establishing relationships between items in your document is a native function - you can link spreadsheets together as you would database tables, and group documents together in a hierarchy. You cannot establish relational links between documents in the same way in Google docs - links are functions of text, and documents are grouped in folders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Right Type of Realtime</strong> - These apps are all real time - any edits you make immediately show up for your team mates, but it doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelming. While I appreciate the realtime nature of a Google doc, it also creates a strange ‚Äúhovering‚Äù social norm that was not well considered. These apps build in the right time of real time norms into their respective types of documents.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve always love to try new products especially when it can help how I work, so I‚Äôm excited to see this new wave of products evolve.</p>

              <p>I was skimming <a href="/20181008/it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work.html}">It Doesn‚Äôt Have to be Crazy at Work</a> again, and there‚Äôs one quote from the chapter ‚ÄúThree‚Äôs Company‚Äù that stuck out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just like work expands to fill the time available, work expands to fill the team available. Short, small projects become big, long projects when too many people are there to work on them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basecamp addresses this by limiting projects to only 3 people. I don‚Äôt have any particular opinion about that number - again, it‚Äôs what works for them.</p>

<p>But it got me thinking of a similar concept - of keeping the <strong>product proportional to the team</strong>.</p>

<p>Chris Dixon <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e">wrote</a> that <em>software is simply the encoding of human thought, and as such has an almost unbounded design space</em>. Building new things is relatively easy, but understanding what it takes to maintain software is difficult. It is a constant balance of new features, fixing what‚Äôs broken, providing tools for internal teams, and so on.</p>

<p>Knowing <strong>what your team is capable of maintaining</strong> is an important limiting factor in what <em>new features</em> you can build. This is an important skill of resource allocation - to factor in the second order effects of a past feature in the future capability of a team.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt mean that small teams cannot build and maintain large pieces of software - quite the contrary. Knowing the upfront requirement of product maintenance becomes forcing function to increase a team‚Äôs capability.</p>

<p>Increasing that capability can happen a number of ways - either through increasing the leverage of the team, or by reducing the surface area of concern. Increasing leverage can happen through automation, testing frameworks, or training and development. Reducing the surface area of concern comes through addressing technical debts, or removing features altogether.</p>

              Startups as Systems of Impact
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I saw <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-product-doesnt-win">an article</a> recently by Jessica Lessin, where she writes about the product-centric mindset that‚Äôs captured Silicon Valley, and how it‚Äôs such an incomplete view of what makes a great company.</p>

<p>I couldn‚Äôt agree more.</p>

<p>Sure, startups are known first for their products. In many cases they are the primary interface to a company. They are no doubt an essential part of what makes a company successful.</p>

<p>But in tech, there‚Äôs a false equivalence of <em>what a product is</em> and <em>what a company is</em>. This view is myopic and reduces the role of people, and ignores the responsibility that a company takes in bringing a product to market.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no doubt product is central to technology companies. However, a successful product today doesn‚Äôt always mean a successful company in the long run. The counter of this is also true - an unsuccessful product today doesn‚Äôt always mean an unsuccessful company in the long run.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1051147012547080192">tweet</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans">Benedict Evans</a>, talks about how startups are a system of building successful products and bringing those products to market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A startup is an idea, and then it‚Äôs an machine for making the idea and a machine for getting people to use the idea. A huge amount of what people mean by ‚Äòa great entrepreneur‚Äô comes in 2 and 3. Especially 3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence - startups are <strong>systems of impact</strong> - they provide leverage to an individual‚Äôs contribution so they can create the biggest possible impact. Organizations that are successful are excellent levers - they grow individuals, they provide them with the opportunities to exercise that leverage, and part of that is building great products and distribution networks.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a direct parallel between this concept and that of the <a href="/20180905/leadership-lattice.html">leadership lattice</a> - a framework created for learning the skills of management and leadership. The lattice encompasses the full range of responsibility of a leader - starting with the individuals and systems of organization. It also speaks to the fact that companies (and their leaders) need to be accountable for both the first order and second order affects of a product in market, another blindspot mentioned in Jessica‚Äôs article.</p>

<p>In other words - company building and leadership development are intertwined - a company‚Äôs long term success is also proportional to the growth potential of it‚Äôs leaders.</p>

              The Future of Work

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In the next few Future Fridays, I wanted to explore the future of work. We‚Äôre just at the beginning of understanding how the internet will change the nature of labor and work itself. This will be an exploration of some larger trends and themes (some of which are overlapping)</p>

<p>These trends will have varying impacts in different organizations - I see them as new tools in the toolbox of company building. Some can and will be disruptive to the nature of work itself, and some will simply be new capabilities.</p>

<p>Some of the topics I will be exploring further:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Connecting the right task to the right person (who does the work)</strong> - This is an exploration of the spectrum of outsourcing and freelance work. The internet is making it possible to give businesses incredible leverage through borrowing other people‚Äôs time and resources. What will happen when this is extended to it‚Äôs fullest potential? Will one person eventually be able to run an enterprise-sized operation?</li>
  <li><strong>The removal of physical boundaries (where the work happens)</strong> - While many workplaces still require physical colocation, many companies are at the forefront of removing that restriction. Physical space is scarce and knowledge work can happen anywhere. There are already companies that are 100% remote - can this be extrapolated further to companies of all sizes, and what does that look like?</li>
  <li><strong>Increasing task level efficiency (how the work happens)</strong> - This is an exploration of how the cadence of companies is increasing, as is the speed of decision and execution. This includes the rise of automation (through robotics and artificial intelligence) all the way to conversational workflows, and how they are playing a role across company operations. What happens as decision and execution times drive to zero?</li>
  <li><strong>A higher order focus (why people work)</strong> - This is an exploration of the changing nature of how people make choices in what to work on. This includes the exploration of a ‚Äúpost capital‚Äù world. This also includes the things companies are doing to increase the cognitive capability and output of its people - from mental health and wellness to fostering better working relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralized governance models</strong> - I‚Äôve explored this through my posts on <a href="/20180916/decentralization-revisited.html">Crypto and Web 3</a>, but will look at how decentralization and a market-based governance model is affecting the structure and makeup of internet companies (it affects everything from decision making to equity structures).</li>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve recently been thinking about the concept of intentionality. It is a philosophical concept that has a pretty <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/huss-int/">abstract meaning</a>.</p>

<p>To me, intentionality is about being aware of yourself at different levels, and doing things with more presence and purpose.</p>

<p>Being intentional with time means understanding how it‚Äôs being spent today, actively planning how I will spend it across multiple time horizons, and being reflective about the past.</p>

<p>Being intentional with knowledge means understanding how I learn, building mental models to increase my learning capability, and actively practicing it across a variety of topics.</p>

<p>Being intentional with money means understanding how my money is spent and developing a sound investment strategy that fits me.</p>

<p>Being intentional about emotion means being aware of my emotional states, what triggers them, and what that teaches me about myself.</p>

<p>Being intentional about my relationships means actively investing in strengthening them everyday, and trying to be as present as possible.</p>

<p>Intentionality makes its way into all parts of your life. Intentionality makes you look inwards, and helps you understand and better yourself. In doing so, you become the biggest subject of your attention. Improving yourself becomes your biggest priority. The anxieties of meeting external expectations disappears, and you can simply focus on what is fully in your control.</p>

              Leadership Lattice: Domain of Self Management
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is part of a series of posts about the <strong>Leadership Lattice</strong>, a framework for learning about the different dimensions of management and leadership.</p>

<p>Managing yourself as a leader is a critical element of the leadership lattice. This lattice is a framework of learning - which in itself is a concern of the domain of self management.</p>

<p>This domain is concerned with managing what you as an individual manager or leader have full agency over - your time, attention, knowledge, capability and emotion. Your ability as a leader to manage each of these areas will have broader impacts on the individuals you manage and the team dynamics, which in turn will have second order impacts across the entire lattice.</p>

<p>Much of what I cover in my posts on <a href="/20180904/productivity-tuesday-habits.html">productivity</a> are practices in the domain of self management, which is why I‚Äôve called ‚Äòproductivity‚Äô the art/science of <strong>practicing leadership on yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>Self management is comprised of the following practices, among others:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Managing your emotional and mental health - This is foundational to self management, and includes practices that help you manage your emotional state. Leadership is all consuming, and it can become a tremendous emotional burden if not managed actively.</li>
  <li>Managing your time and attention - you have just as many hours in the day as everyone else in your org, and yet a disproportionate set of responsibilities. This includes understanding where your time is being spent today, how is should be best spent, and where you can have the most leverage.</li>
  <li>Managing your knowledge and capability - your growth as a leader is a function of how quickly you learn. Actively managing your own learning capability is critical to your leadership capability. This lattice is an attempt to make this process easier</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the last domain in the lattice. In previous weeks, we covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/20180912/leadership-practice-individual-domain.html">The Individual Domain</a></li>
  <li><a href="/20180919/leadership-latticework-organization.html">The Organization Domain</a></li>
  <li><a href="/20180927/leadership-lattice-application-domain.html">The Application Domain</a></li>
  <li><a href="/20181004/leadership-lattice-impact-domain.html">The Impact Domain</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In a future post, I‚Äôll be writing a summary of all of these domains and how they work together as an interconnected system.</p>

              Lectures on Time: Randy Pausch and Jeremie Saunders
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Dr. Randy Pausch, best known for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Lecture">‚ÄúLast Lecture‚Äù</a>, fittingly had some some timeless advice on time management and shared it in an incredible lecture.</p>

<iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTugjssqOT0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Ofcourse, the Last Lecture is a classic presentation on the value of time and has been turned into a New York Times best selling book.</p>

<p>His thoughtfulness about the value of every minute reminded me of a similar talk I saw at TEDxToronto by Jeremie Saunders - the co-founder of the Sickboy Podcast, who has been diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis since childhood. He has an incredible story and beautiful perspective on life.</p>

              Book Review: It Doesn&#39;t Have to Be Crazy at Work
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Basecamp has always been at the forefront of mythbusting startup norms. They have contributed so much to the startup community - from technology (<a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>), to operating frameworks (<a href="https://basecamp.com/books/remote">Remote</a>), to lessons on company culture shared over two decades of iteration.</p>

<p>Their most recent book, <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm">It Doesn‚Äôt Have to Be Crazy at Work</a>, is a manifesto for a calmer, more thoughtful approach to company building. Jason Fried and DHH advocate for some seemingly radical ideas - things like no goals or long term plans and encouraging an interruption and meeting-free culture. While it can come across as being a bit dogmatic at times, I appreciate them openly sharing their approach (one that clearly works for them).</p>

<p>It‚Äôs interesting to have read this today, because just yesterday I <a href="/20181007/ventakesh-rao-plugged-in-turnpike.html">wrote</a> about Venkatesh Rao‚Äôs thinking about how we need to build a muscle memory for all types of information streams. The approach in this book feels like the antithesis.</p>

<p>Regardless - it‚Äôs a quick read, and a refreshing take on company building and culture. Get it <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm">here</a>.</p>

              <p>Another short post today, this one about a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1047925106423603200">tweetstorm</a> by Venkatesh Rao.</p>

<p>In it, Venkatesh argues for building the muscles to stay connected to all streams of information - from the high-latency, live, and lower quality (e.g. the so called ‚Äútoxic twitter streams‚Äù) to the low-latency but higher minded (e.g. philosophy books).</p>

<p>He maps the information types on a spectrum in this graph:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/plugged-in-turnpike.png" alt="Plugged-In Turnpike" /></p>

<p>I agree with the spirit of it, and believe we do need to adapt ourselves to be able to process the information onslaught instead of taking a ‚Äúlog cabin‚Äù approach and retreat towards only higher-order thinking. Also believe there‚Äôs a natural ebb and flow up and down the ‚Äúplugged-in turnpike‚Äù that the mind will naturally take, and we need to follow it there vs. trying to stop it.</p>

<p>It also requires a level of self awareness about your own learning framework to understanding how your brain best processes information, and act on it proportional to where you are on the turnpike.</p>

<p>One of my favourites is The Knowledge Project, the podcast of the <a href="http://www.fs.blog">The Farnam Street blog</a> by Shane Parrish. I often reference Farnam Street in my posts especially around Mental Models. The knowledge project is all signal and features some excellent conversations - some of my favourites being with Ray Dalio, Naval Ravikant, Tobi Lutke, Sanjay Bakshi and Venkatesh Rao.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also a member of the associated Learning Community of the blog.</p>

<p>I find myself recommending both the blog and podcast on a regular basis. They have changed my outlook on so much, and informed how I think about learning, personal growth and investing.</p>

              Smart Locks and the Home Permissions Layer
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve been spending a lot of time at home for a parental leave, and have been thinking about how technology is going to play a stronger role in making our lives easier at home and in our neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs been a lot of activity in this space for many years now - from Alexa to Homekit becoming the OS for our homes, to the assortment of smart-everything devices.</p>

<p>All of these are exciting in their own right, but I believe the smart door lock is particularly consequential. The smart lock creates a use case that goes beyond the home itself - it can help change the nature of how we work with home service providers, and help to build stronger communities.</p>

<p>When a smart lock is installed, it gives the owners the ability to generate multiple keys to the house. Those keys can be activated and deactivated remotely, and distributed to members of the household or other trusted people. This capability gives the home a ‚Äúpermissions layer‚Äù.</p>

<p>The ability to generate keys for other trusted people is the most powerful concept. This can be used for service providers like contractors, delivery people, the cable guys, dog walkers, nannies, and so on.</p>

<p>For residents of the home, you no longer have to be home for service providers to do the work on your house, fix your cable, or drop off a package. For the service providers (contractors especially) they don‚Äôt have to worry about offering services outside of a traditional 9-5 schedule when you are home.</p>

<p>A central service can now offer the ability to schedule service providers and create a specific key for them, valid only for the day and times they are scheduled to arrive.</p>

<p>The use case is when you leave the house every morning to go to work, you‚Äôll know exactly who‚Äôs coming in, what services they are going to provide, and most importantly - you‚Äôll come home to a house where many chores are already done for you.</p>

<p>Trust is the obvious question - why would I trust strangers to come into my house? This is where you can follow the Uber and Lyft trust infrastructure model (which has it‚Äôs own flaws, but largely works). After all, we would never have imagined getting into a strangers car to have them drive us somewhere, until Uber and Lyft provided the infrastructure to do so.</p>

<p>What is stopping this currently is the massive amout of fragmentation in smart locks, which makes it difficult to offer a seamless user experience. However, the connection to Homekit and Alexa makes this future possible.</p>

<p>Infact, it is already here - Amazon launched a service called Amazon Key for their package delivery service. I can easily see this being extended beyond just one type of service.</p>

<p>This also has obvious network effects - the more people with a smart door lock, the more benefit to other users as it can drive down prices and create economies of scale. A contractor may be able to offer discounts for adjacent homes and apartments using smart door locks. Sharing service providers - something that already happens in neighbourhoods today - can go a long way to create a stronger sense of community as well.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Today, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies">published an incredible story</a> about how Chinese spies implanted microchips into motherboards that ended up in the servers of the biggest technology companies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But that‚Äôs just what U.S. investigators found: The chips had been inserted during the manufacturing process, two officials say, by operatives from a unit of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army. In Supermicro, China‚Äôs spies appear to have found a perfect conduit for what U.S. officials now describe as the most significant supply chain attack known to have been carried out against American companies.</p>

              Leadership Lattice: Impact Domain
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is part of a series of posts about the <strong>Leadership Lattice</strong>, a framework for learning about the different dimensions of management and leadership.</p>

<p>The next layer of the Leadership Lattice is the Impact domain - it‚Äôs what all the previous layers add up to.</p>

<p>The impact domain is concerned with the broader impact of an organization‚Äôs products and services in market. For smaller, single product organizations - it can be argued that impact stops at the previous domain - after all, that‚Äôs where we talked about the <em>outcomes</em> of teams. For bigger organizations, this includes the second order impacts - how your products impact society and the world as a whole.</p>

<p>As grand as this sounds - this domain has a fairly narrow set of concerns. It is in this domain that the mission and vision of an organization is set. The mission is the grander purpose of why the organization exists, and the vision is the ‚Äòend state‚Äô of how this can be realized.</p>

<p>However, this can also be where negative second order effects are realized. For all the positive change we look to create in technology, our disruption mindsets often blind us to the negative consequences of success. Zuckerberg famously stood in front of congress and said he didn‚Äôt consider some of Facebook‚Äôs impact within his domain of responsibility. I use that to make a point about the domain, not about Zuckerberg or Facebook. Ultimately it‚Äôs the leaders that are accountable for these effects, no matter how broadly they are realized.</p>

<p>The guiding mental model here is <em>second order thinking</em>. This is the exercise of thinking of decision consquences beyond the immediate and obvious. It‚Äôs about asking - ‚Äúand then what?‚Äù. Second order thinking recognizes everything is a system and our decisions will have ripple effects, and it‚Äôs our responsibility to [at a minimum] understand those impacts.  The products we build can have massive positive and negative impacts in the world - it‚Äôs about understanding and taking ownership over those consequences. This is the ultimate burden of leadership.</p>

<p>The practices in this domain are, as I mentioned, rather narrow - mostly because it‚Äôs either one person (the CEO), or a very small group of people carrying out this practice.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mission and Vision Setting, which reveals the positive intended consequences</li>
  <li>Long Term Planning, this is on a longer time horizon than the regular strategic planning of an organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some frameworks that can help here are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/01/to-lead-create-a-shared-vision">Shared Vision</a>, something also used in the Fifth Discipline</li>
  <li><a href="https://archive.artefactgroup.com/the-tarot-cards-of-tech/">Tarot Cards of Tech</a> is a playful framework to evaluate the longer term impacts of your products in market</li>

              Mobile 3.0
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve worked in the mobile industry since 2001.</p>

<p>When I worked at Amazon.com as a co-op student, I asked to be placed on a fledgling team called ‚ÄúAmazon Anywhere‚Äù. It was formed to make Amazon work ‚Äúanywhere outside the PC‚Äù (or so I‚Äôd heard). I remember building WAP pages and voice apps. I built a product where you could call a 1-800 number and order the latest Harry Potter book. Building and consuming mobile ‚Äúapps‚Äù was full of friction.</p>

<p>Mobile has come a long way since then, mostly because of the seminal introduction of the iPhone in 2007.</p>

<p>Today, there are 2.5 billion smartphone users all around the world. Some of the most valuable companies in the world have been built because of this invention.</p>

<p>And I think we‚Äôre just getting started. I think the next decade of mobile is going to be the realization of it‚Äôs fullest potential - a stage I‚Äôll call <strong>Mobile 3.0</strong>.</p>

<p>First, some definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobile 1.0</strong> (pre-smartphone) was about telecommunications networks, SMS and wireless data. Carriers had all the power in this stage - they owned the pipe and controlled content through their ‚Äúdecks‚Äù. Building a mobile software company was an expensive endeavor.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile 2.0</strong> (the transition to smartphones) was about all the race to own the mobile OS and the app ecosystem. Carriers lost power and it went to device manufacturers. The mobile form factor was solidifed, and phones evolved to get better displays, more sensors and a deeper software stack. Apps flourished and became a part of our everyday lives.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile 3.0</strong> (smartphones everywhere) is about what‚Äôs next - the realization of the smartphone‚Äôs full potential as a ubiquitous computing platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe this will happen in a number of ways, some listed below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Infrastructure built for mobile ubiquity: There are 2.5 billion smartphone in consumers hands. Their ubiquity will mean more real world infrastructure will be built with an assumption that everyone has a phone. We will use smartphones to unlock our homes, start our cars, and use them as passports. Many of these use cases already exist today - this future will become more evenly distributed. Everyday objects will either disappear or transform based on this ubiquity. At the software layer, these utilities will require a stronger tie to real world identity and necessitate a stronger trust infrastructure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apps will become smaller and distribution dynamics will change: The first decade of the smartphone was also the web vs. native app debate. Web apps did not replace mobile apps, but the native app installation process remains one of the biggest points of friction. To overcome this, existing apps will become platforms for ‚Äúmicro-app‚Äù ecosystems. The app stores themselves are already experimenting with previewing apps and micro-versions of app experiences to overcome this hurdle. From a development standpoint, frameworks like React Native and Expo are making it possible for continuous deployment of apps (Expo is a development platform but also a ‚Äúbrowser of apps‚Äù). In Asia, it‚Äôs already proven how messaging apps can become app ecosystems, although that hasn‚Äôt been realized in North America just yet. While Facebook has the natural advantage, it has a lot to do to rebuild trust with app developers based on how it has treated publishers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mobile native entertainment: The first decade of mobile was about mobile becoming the dominant distribution platform for media. But the media formats we‚Äôre consuming has been largely defined in a pre-smartphone era. This is changing as the worlds of gaming, video, publishing and music are combining to create a new <em>mobile native</em> media formats. New consumption business models will be built beyond simple subscription and a-la-carte, and new consumption patterns will develop especially in short-form narrative content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Real world manipulation using on-device AI and AR. The combination of these two technologies on the smartphone will create a new breed of real world services. AI will help apps ‚Äúrecognize‚Äù the world around them, and AR helps them ‚Äúmodify‚Äù it. These two capabilities together create the ability to manipulate reality. A great example of this is the Homecourt app recently demo‚Äôd during the iOS 12 launch. AR apps will be the differentiating factor in device sales - control of the hardware and software stack will help Apple capture most of the value share here.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Mobile is nowhere near done, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what the next few years have in store.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is a short post about an attitude towards productivity.</p>

<p>The more I read about and understand the tools of <em>productivity</em>, the clearer it is that it‚Äôs more about a mindset than any specific tactic, habit or tool.</p>

<p>Infact, productivity is less about changing behaviors than it is about <em>understanding yourself</em>.</p>

<p>The self help industry is obsessed with the former. It can be insufferable with all the ideal morning routines, to-do apps and prioritization frameworks. These create more anxiety than motivation (ymmv), and often leaves me feeling worse about myself.</p>

<p><strong>Contentment</strong> is the antidote. Contentment is a mental state of both accepting who you are today - and spending the time to really understand your own behaviour. Some other notes on this state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It provides a baseline and a springboard for any change. When you do go about applying a change after this, it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre fighting yourself.</li>
  <li>Contentment changes your attitude about the day. Every day feels like an opportunity to reset and refresh and try things anew. You stop focusing on time counting down and more on your abilities compounding.</li>
  <li>Being in a state of simple acceptance of who you are, is kind of like an everpresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a> - the state of ‚Äúenergized focus, full involvement and enjoyment‚Äù.</li>

              Decision Making Frameworks
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is a continuation of the previous post on <a href="/20181001/learning-loops.html">Learning Loops</a>. Decision making frameworks guide execution and are the ‚Äúproblem solving‚Äù step in the learning loop. This post is a collection of frameworks that can help with decision making in a variety of contexts. Note that a decision is also informed by your current understanding of the world through mental models.</p>

<p>Just like other frameworks - think of these as tools in your toolbelt when faced with any decision. If given the luxury of time, apply multiple frameworks to make the decision.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inversion</strong> is thinking about a problem backwards - it is about achieving positive outcomes by simply avoiding any negative outcomes. This was popularized by Charlie Munger, who also used a great example to illustrate it: ‚ÄúIf you want to help India, the question you should ask is not ‚Äúhow can I help India,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat is doing the worst damage in India? What will automatically do the worst damage and how do I avoid it?‚Äù. Often the things you want to avoid end up happening because of wrong information, wrong mental models, or our own failure to learn. More on Inversion <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/">here</a> and <a href="https://25iq.com/2015/09/12/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-charlie-munger-about-inversion-including-the-importance-of-being-consistently-not-stupid-2/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Divergent and Convergent Thinking</strong> is the exercise of creating multiple options (divergence), and then narrowing down on those options (convergence). When faced with decisions, it‚Äôs always useful to articulate <em>all</em> the possible outcomes before making a choice about any specific one. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking">Wikipedia</a> page for convergent thinking is this important insight - ‚Äúit is most effective in situations where an answer readily exists and simply needs to be either recalled or worked out through decision making strategies‚Äù.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Decision Reversibility and Consequence</strong> is an evaluation of a decision based on how easy it is to undo. This concept was made famous by Jeff Bezos in one of his <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">annual letters</a>, in which he described decisions that are difficult to undo as ‚ÄúType 1‚Äù and those that are not as Type 2. Type 1 decisions, given they have greater consequences, require more thought. Type 2 decisions should be made quickly. Related to this concept is the <a href="https://fs.blog/2018/09/decision-matrix/">decision matrix</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Second Order Thinking</strong> is the exercise of thinking of decision consquences beyond the immediate and obvious. It‚Äôs about asking - ‚Äúand then what?‚Äù. Second order thinking recognizes everything is a system and our decisions will have ripple effects, and it‚Äôs our responsibility to [at a minimum] understand those impacts. It often reveals whether we <em>should</em> do something. More on second order thinking <a href="https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Charlie Munger‚Äôs Two Step Framework</strong> (unofficial name) is a simple way of making decisions by considering two factors. First, understand the forces at play. This is simply understanding what you know and what you don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs your job to educate yourself as much as possible. Second, understand how your subconscious might be leading you astray. There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a> that affect our decision making, and being aware of them helps you make more objective decisions. For example, recency bias is when we place too much weight on something because we‚Äôve just experienced or read about it. More on this framework <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/04/munger-two-step/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Checklist Manifesto</strong> is a book by Atul Gawande about how checklists help professions like pilots to surgeons make the right decisions. In effect, the checklist manifesto is a systematic approach to decision making which creates discipline, enables teamwork, and most importantly, avoid mistakes. Whether it‚Äôs an investment decision or a heart surgery - a well structured checklist can be the different between success and disaster. More on the <a href="http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/">Checklist Manifesto approach to decisions</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>80/20 Rule of Decisions</strong> is a an application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> to decision making. In essence, it says that once you have 80% of the information to make a decision, it‚Äôs best to make the call and decide. Getting that additional 20% is often expensive and inconsequential, given that <em>most</em> decisions are reversible.</p>

    <p><strong>First Principles Thinking</strong> is an approach to making decisions that trys to recognize and eliminate any engrained assumptions about how the world works. It‚Äôs often used as a tool to unlock creativity. It forces you to go to the fundamental constraints of a problem - the things you absolutely cannot change even if you tried - and build up a solution from there. First Principles thinking is classic <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/elon-musks-3-step-first-principles-thinking-how-to-think-and-solve-difficult-problems-like-a-ba1e73a9f6c0">Elon Musk</a>.</p>

              Learning Loops
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A learning loop is a simplified framework of how people learn from experience - it‚Äôs a simplified model of how our brain works. There are versions of learning loops everywhere - from self improvement frameworks to product development. Being intentional about our learning loops (and improving them) has wide ranging benefits.</p>

<p>In it‚Äôs simplest form, the learning loop is a <em>single loop</em>. It is the cycle of decision making to execution to learning, which then informs future decisions. Decisions are also informed by our mental models and decision frameworks.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/singleloop.png" alt="Single Loop Learning" /></p>

<p>A double learning loop connects the learning step (‚Äúinformation feedback‚Äù in the diagram above) to the mental models. In double loop learning, the mental models and frameworks we use changes depending on our learning. Essentially, we don‚Äôt blindly follow a singular framework to execute anything, but modify it based on a situation. I like this as a way to articulate how a latticework of mental models is built and used.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/doubleloop.png" alt="Double Loop Learning" /></p>

<p>The concept of double loop learning was described by Chris Argyris, in a simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A thermostat that automatically turns on the heat whenever the temperature in a room drops below 68¬∞F is a good example of single-loop learning. A thermostat that could ask, ‚Äúwhy am I set to 68¬∞F?‚Äù and then explore whether or not some other temperature might more economically achieve the goal of heating the room would be engaged in double-loop learning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve written about some of the steps in the loop in various contexts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wrote about <a href="/20180903/mental-models.html">mental models</a> as the simplified concepts and frameworks we use to better understand how the world works</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve written about <a href="/20180911/productivity-planning-retros.html">habits of reflection</a> in a personal productivity context</li>
</ul>

<p>In future posts, I‚Äôll go through the steps of <strong>decision making</strong> and <strong>execution</strong> (‚Äúreal world‚Äù in the diagram), with a focus on providing some specific frameworks that can be used in each stage.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/20180930/calendar-product-platform.html">
              The Calendar as a Network and Platform
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Calendars are some of the most used apps in our smartphones. They are an indispensible utility with a wide spectrum of usage patterns. Some use it casually, but for many it dictate their lives - if it isn‚Äôt on a calendar, it isn‚Äôt happening (I suspect this behaviour is correlated with age).</p>

<p>Despite this, the calendar remains fairly undeveloped. The calendar today is not a far cry from the one that was preloaded with the original iPhone in 2007. Managing your life through today‚Äôs calendars is still full of friction - and from personal experience can become the sole reason why events don‚Äôt take place. For some, it is so cumbersome that it requires a full time assistant. This is an expensive problem.</p>

<p>I believe this is for a few reasons, centered around two fundamental design flaws.</p>

<p>First, <strong>the calendar is an inherently social app that we are all forced to play in single player mode</strong>. We plan events with colleagues, friends and family, but the social mechanics of event planning feels like a bad turn based game. The lack of real time back and forth, the consistent context switching between our communication apps and calendars is a massive point of frustration.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>the primary calendar abstraction as a ledger of time is woefully incomplete</strong>. Events have way more nuance - whether it‚Äôs the decisions leading up to acceptance, the last minute flurry of activity close to events, or sharing meeting notes with attendees. All these activities require context switching that could be unnecessary. Working through a calendar today is like doing all your accounting directly on the ledger - it works, but it can drive you crazy.</p>

<p>Just fixing these two would be enough - but the calendar is also highly underleveraged.</p>

<p><strong>Calendars are a utility, but can also be a network and platform</strong>. They contain long term intentions through events - meetings, social gatherings, even vacations - which is central to to reservation centric businesses and service providers. A calendar can become a central distribution point for these businesses.</p>

<p>This is best illustrated by some use cases. For example - airlines can automatically send me flight deals when they see I‚Äôve booked off certain dates for vacation. I can automatically book service providers without explicit contact by adding an event to my calendar and getting real time feedback on availability. Restaurants can even ‚Äúbid‚Äù for future time in a shared calendar with my friends, sending us offers on deals on days where we are all free (this has clear privacy and security issues, but just an illustration).</p>

<p>As mobile enters it‚Äôs second decade - I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how calendar apps might evolve to help address some of these problems. I think there is a lot of potential here.</p>

              Web 3: Consensus
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>The last few Future Friday‚Äôs, I‚Äôve focused on Web 3. I explored how the blockchain is paving the way for a <a href="/20180916/decentralization-revisited.html">decentralized networks</a>, and how those networks can be developed and governed using <a href="/20180921/web3-designing-networks-tokens.html">crypto tokens</a> as incentives.</p>

<p>Today I want to cover some details of how data is transmitted and how people reach agreement within a decentralized world using Blockchains.</p>

<p>In order for a decentralized world to work, there needs to be a few elements in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability for one node in a network to reliably send messages to another without a central party - a reliable and trustworthy method of <em>peer-to-peer messaging</em>.</li>
  <li>The ability for multiple computers to agree on the validity of a transaction, a problem known as <em>consensus</em>. A transaction can be any blockchain-based transaction - it can be to record the transfer of digital assets like Bitcoin, but also for something like file transfers (as used in <a href="https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/learn-to-securely-share-files-on-the-blockchain-with-ipfs-219ee47df54c">IPFS</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these are solved by cryptography.</p>

<p>Peer to peer messaging is done using public-key cryptography and digital signatures. Public Key Cryptography is a cryptographic system that relies on a pair of keys, a  secret private key and an ‚Äòopen‚Äô public key which is broadcasted out to the network. This system helps ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message by relying on advanced cryptographic techniques. (<a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/how-does-blockchain-use-public-key-cryptography/">source</a>)</p>

<p>Agreement on the validity of transaction is done using a <em>consensus algorithm</em> agreed to by all members of the blockchain. This consensus algorithm is used to validate transactions on the chain without needing a central party. There are two forms of conensus (<a href="https://mastanbtc.github.io/blockchainnotes/blockchaintypes/#what-is-consensus">source</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Permissionless, in which every node in the network participate in consensus procedure, e.g. Bitcoin Blockchain (Proof of Work)</li>
  <li>Permissioned, in which only Selected nodes (validators, e.g. Government or trusted nodes) participate in consensus procedure</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of most common consensus algorithms being used by different blockchains today are Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin), and Proof of Stake.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Proof of Work (PoW), where a node on the network has to solve mathematically complex puzzles on the new block before approving the block to the ledger. After solving the puzzle, the solution is then forwarded to other miners and verified by them before being accepted to their respective copies of the ledger (<a href="https://medium.com/@BangBitTech/what-is-consensus-algorithm-in-blockchain-different-types-of-consensus-models-12cce443fc77">source</a>).</li>
  <li>Proof of Stake (PoS), in which a node on the network is selected to verify the transaction based on how much token ownership they have.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@BangBitTech/what-is-consensus-algorithm-in-blockchain-different-types-of-consensus-models-12cce443fc77">This</a> is a great article summarizing some of the most common consensus algorithms.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://medium.com/imbrexblog/web-3-consensus-mechanisms-2dcfb7bfaadb">Web 3 Consensus Mechanisms</a> on the importance of consensus mechanisms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consensus mechanisms are a integral to blockchain technology and other distributed systems. They are the basis on which participants of a given network with a range of varied self-interests, and even a mutual distrust for one another, can come to an agreement on the validity of data and transactions. <strong>The consensus model implemented by a project, company or team is the heart of its security, communication, and sustainability</strong>.</p>

              Leadership Lattice: Application Domain
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is part of a series of posts about the <strong>Leadership Lattice</strong>, a framework for learning about the different dimensions of management and leadership.</p>

<p>The next layer of the Leadership Lattice is the application domain, which is about managing the output and outcomes of the organization. This is about <em>what the company creates</em>. It‚Äôs about the products and services that the team offers, and the markets in which they operate.</p>

<p>A leader is ultimately accountable for the output and outcome of the team. However, it‚Äôs easy to disproportionately spend time in this domain (especially becoming prescriptive about outputs). This is a common misstep I‚Äôve noticed in new leaders, and one I‚Äôve made many times myself. The most sustainable leadership approaches are ultimately exercised through people and teams.</p>

<p>This is a very expansive domain of concern, and can easily be divided into two sub-domains: outputs and outcomes. Outputs are what teams do, and outcomes are the results of those outputs. Outputs are often divided into functions - sales, engineering, product management, support. Outcomes are measured within the environment those outputs operate - in markets, with customers - both external and internal.</p>

<p>It may seem as if one guiding mental model is not enough - but I think the concept of the <em>learning loop</em> covers it quite well. The learning loop is the cycle of decision making &gt; execution &gt; learning that takes place in organizations. Decisions guide execution, which creates learning, which in turn drives decisions. This cycle occurs at an individual level, team level, and organization level. As such, there is an argument for making the individual and team concerns a part of their respective layers in the lattice. What you do, how you do it, and what results from this across different timescales is a good way to encapsulate the application domain.</p>

<p>The practices of this domain include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Market Strategy</li>
  <li>Strategic Planning</li>
  <li>Decision Making Frameworks</li>
  <li>Functional Excellence (sales, product, engineering, etc)</li>
  <li>Analytics and Research</li>
  <li>Knowledge management</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôll be collecting more frameworks to share in this domain. However, given the domain is so expansive and domain specific, it can‚Äôt really be covered in one post.</p>

              Failing at New Habits
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>A few months ago, in an effort to get back into building things, I committed to writing <em>some</em> code everyday. Last month, I chose to <a href="/20180827/starting-a-new-habit.html">build a writing habit</a>. I somehow managed to build both habits into my day, often doing them together in the form of this blog.</p>

<p>Based on these results, I became optimistic about my ability to build habits. In weekly planning, I became intentional about which habits I‚Äôm choosing to start, edit or remove. In the last few weeks, I tried to build in more habits into my days and weeks. I‚Äôve attempted to track what I eat and drink, read before I go to sleep, meditate in the mornings, and start a bodyweight workout routine.</p>

<p>I quickly overcommitted, and failed at establishing any one of them consistently.</p>

<p>I wanted to share some observations of my own behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Habits need to be built <em>slower</em> to really stick. I need to give myself time to get adjusted to the new behaviours and find efficiencies. Essentially, I can‚Äôt go from building 1 new habit a month to 3.</li>
  <li>I need to better understand and most importantly, <em>stick to</em> the ideal times for a habit. I mostly write at night but sometimes will also start a post in the daytime. This will obviously take away from any daytime habits I‚Äôm trying to build.</li>
  <li>I underestimated initial ‚Äúsetup time‚Äù. It‚Äôs obvious but worth nothing -  writing every day requires a different setup than meditation or working out. I didn‚Äôt consider the initial barrier to entry for the new habits.</li>
</ul>

<p>The theme of overcommitment is common and also applies to discrete tasks (something I observed in <a href="/20180918/time-tracking-update.html">tracking to-do completion rates</a>). While I think it‚Äôs possible to build in these new behaviours, I need to be much more intentional about how and when it‚Äôs done.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll share more progress as I continue to build these habits into my daily and weekly routine.</p>

              <p>In the last few Productivity Tuesday‚Äôs I‚Äôve been covered some <a href="/20180911/productivity-planning-retros.html">practices</a> that apply to managing hours, days and weeks. Planning on longer time scales requires deeper thought and reflection, and different frameworks to help make decisions. These frameworks can help identify the sense of <em>purpose</em> which then liberates us to focus and make the most of every day.</p>

<p>Ikigai is one such framework. Ikigai helps to identify a sense of purpose by looking at the intersections of one‚Äôs capability, opportunity and interest.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/ikigai.jpg" alt="Ikigai" width="500px" /></p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Our twin girls Jade and Laila are three months old now. It‚Äôs also the half way mark of my 6 month paternity leave.</p>

<p>Taking this time has been one of the most rewarding and clarifying times in my adult life.</p>

<p>Some reflections from the first three months of parenting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It‚Äôs a scary and magical responsibility to steward a child‚Äôs early development. Scary because there is a a mountain of parenting advice out there and you‚Äôre never quite sure who to listen to. Magical because you get to be a part of someone‚Äôs journey in discovering <em>everything</em> for the first time. I don‚Äôt have all the words for this yet, so I‚Äôm just going to leave it there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Becoming a parent forced me to be very intentional about my own identity. Parenting twins is all-consuming and more intense than a full time job, even with help (I have the <a href="/20180918/time-tracking-update.html">data</a>). In preparation for this and leading up to my parental leave, I reflected deeply on the things that matter the most to me. That exercise helped to guide where I spend any free time I get. For me, making sure I had a productive and creative outlet was very important, which I‚Äôve found in a <a href="/20180827/starting-a-new-habit.html">few</a> <a href="/20180830/time.html">ways</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel incredibly fortunate on so many levels. To have two healthy children, to have the love and support of family and friends, to live in a society with free healthcare. This experience has only heightened my civic sense. I have greater appreciation for the layers of social infrastructure that constitute privelege.</p>

              The Slack Product, Network and Ecosystem
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Slack is one of the fastest growing technology companies today, and perhaps the fastest growing product in the small business and enterprise software market.</p>

<p>This is a short post is about the broader potential I see for Slack, outside of the obvious fact it is a group chat product aimed at the workplace.</p>

<p><strong>Slack is a new way of getting work done.</strong> Today‚Äôs knowledge work requires coordination and communication, and a larger portion of our jobs is connected work. With Slack and the app ecosystem, workflows that used to live in separate web applications are now <em>inside the conversation</em> itself. Users don‚Äôt have to switch contexts to change the status of a bug, to advance a deal in a sales pipeline, or to respond to a customer - it all lives within one app. Slack‚Äôs slogan is ‚Äúwhere work happens‚Äù - which I think speaks more to it‚Äôs app ecosystem than it‚Äôs capability as a group chat product. This is why I believe Slack‚Äôs biggest competition is not <em>email</em> - it‚Äôs <strong>the entire web browser</strong>. I do not believe Slack will absorb all workflows - only the ones for which there is coordination, information sharing, or handoff between people. Knowledge work requires a balance between connected work and deep solitary work.</p>

<p><strong>Slack is a new way to launch business software.</strong> With workflows embedded inside conversations, business software is being unbundled and widgetized. These widgets are not as functional as working in a web browser, but are quickly <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/introducing-actions-a-simple-shortcut-attached-to-every-slack-message-e2404414ece">getting better</a>. Eventually, Slack‚Äôs platform capabilities will include common components of the SaaS stack. Using Slack login - which provides access to the users and channels in a workplace, business software developers no longer have to worry about building a login/signup flow, user, team and permissions model. Another part of the SaaS stack is pricing - I believe Slack will (or should) launch a pricing or payments service for it‚Äôs app developers to charge individual users or channels. This pricing model would be native to Slack apps are used. All this reduces the R&amp;D effort required to build business software. On top of this, Slack provides new distribution dynamics not available in the world of business software. This is because of meteoric growth and the ability for app developers to add software inside a conversation. I imagine a new crop of SaaS companies will be created that are ‚ÄúSlack-first‚Äù vs Browser-first. This is a paradigm shift and will require a change of thinking in the world of SaaS.</p>

<p><strong>Slack is a new professional network</strong>. Slack‚Äôs user-channel-workspace structure is a more realistic model for a professional network. The channel model is a great way of encapsulating the connections and structures at work. The addition of <a href="https://slackhq.com/introducing-shared-channels-where-you-can-work-with-anyone-in-slack">shared channels</a> between workspaces helps to create connections between users and teams across workplaces. One user can also join multiple workspaces, which helps to build an interest graph. For example, a Product Manager could be on their work Slack, but then also a Product Management Slack workspace, an alumni workspace, etc. This is a very different way than how the LinkedIn network is structured.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the continual growth of Slack and the app ecosystem around it.</p>

              <p>A very short article today, as <a href="/20180921/web3-designing-networks-tokens.html">yesterday‚Äôs post</a> took more time than expected and required some edits today.</p>

<p>In this video, Ray Dalio shares how Bridgewater navigated the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

<iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g4LZsG6wo-o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>It‚Äôs a great video, and I didn‚Äôt realize the role that Bridgewater played, especially in highlighting the problem to the highest levels of government.</p>

<p>Some takeaways that can be applied to investing in other contexts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is very difficult to see the signals when you‚Äôre in the middle of a crisis. History repeats itself, and there is a lot to learn from past financial crises that can provide the perspective necessary to make the right decision.</li>
  <li>A solid framework (the depression indicator, in Bridgewater‚Äôs case) and the strength to stick to the associated action plan helped Bridgewater navigate the crisis.</li>
  <li>There is so much irrationality and human emotion tied into investment decisions. The environment of humility and critical thinking within the investment team at Bridgewater helped to create more confidence during uncertain times.</li>

<p>From <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef">Crypto Tokens: A Breakthrough in Open Network Design</a>:‚Ää</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Networks - computing networks, developer platforms, marketplaces, social networks, etc‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähave always been a powerful part of the promise of the internet. Tens of thousands of networks have been incubated by developers and entrepreneurs, yet only a very small percentage of those have survived, and most of those were owned and controlled by private companies. Networks become more powerful as new participants join, a phenomenon known as network effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best way to grow a network today is to build an application and scale it‚Äôs adoption to as many people as possible. Those that have invested in growing the network, whether its a social network, marketplace, or developer platforms, are most often the equity holders of corporations (employers, investors). They are the ones that reap the financial benefits of network control.</p>

<p>There are a few issues with this.</p>

<p>First, related to the core trust issue, is the financial benefit is not always distributed with the participants of the network. When it is shared, it is controlled by that same central party - often in the form of arbitrary revenue share. The second issue is the nature of the benefit itself which is in the form of a in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money">fiat currency</a>. A more ideal benefit would be more native to the network - something where investing in the network allows you to extract some benefit from the network itself.</p>

<p>This is where tokens come in. Tokens are a kind of virtual currency, akin to what is used in games. We can create new tokens specific to a protocol and have all transactions of the token written to the blockchain for that protocol. What this does is prevent a sender from ‚Äúdouble spending‚Äù a token, so when an asset is sent it cannot be used again by the sender.</p>

<p>A digital asset can be transferred like money moving between accounts - without a central authority like a bank.</p>

<p>This is a powerful capability, because every protocol can have a currency associated with it. Put another way, the ability to <em>program money</em> can now be <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1033050236963323904">built into</a> a protocol. Also, every protocol can now have an associated marketplace that can serve multiple purposes to benefit the protocol.</p>

<p>This marketplace can be used to fund development of the protocol itself. The developer of the network (i.e. the protocol developer) can issue a fixed number of tokens and put them on sale and raise funds through an ICO (initial coin offering). Note this is only one way to fund development - an ICO is not necessary to develop a blockchain powered protocol.</p>

<p>This token marketplace also behaves as a tool of governance. Continued investment in the market through buying tokens is a way to signal to the protocol developers that they are ‚Äúdoing the right thing‚Äù.</p>

<p>This is a great summary of the flywheel effect of how protocol tokens appreciate in value (from <a href="http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols">Fat Protocols</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When a token appreciates in value, it draws the attention of early speculators, developers and entrepreneurs. They become stakeholders in the protocol itself and are financially invested in its success. Then some of these early adopters, perhaps financed in part by the profits of getting in at the start, build products and services around the protocol, recognizing that its success would further increase the value of their tokens. Then some of these become successful and bring in new users to the network and perhaps VCs and other kinds of investors. This further increases the value of the tokens, which draws more attention from more entrepreneurs, which leads to more applications, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the blockchain and tokens, protocols themselves can now be encoded with shared logic, data and a native currency.</p>

<p>This quote really sums the promise and potential of tokens (from <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef">Crypto Tokens: A Breakthrough in Open Network Design</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If present trends continue, they will soon be seen as a breakthrough in the design and development of open networks, combining the societal benefits of open protocols with the financial and architectural benefits of proprietary networks. They are also an extremely promising development for those hoping to keep the internet accessible to entrepreneurs, developers, and other independent creators.</p>

  <p>While a geographical map is helpful if you want to find your way around the world, a population cartogram is the representation that we need if we want to know where our fellow humans are at home.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a powerful visual that puts a lot into perspective. A very quick analysis of the top 15 most populous countries and how they rank in terms of nominal GDP (<a href="http://statisticstimes.com/economy/projected-world-gdp-ranking.php">source</a>).</p>

              Leadership Latticework: The Organization Domain
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is part of a series of posts about the <strong>Leadership Lattice</strong>, a framework for learning about the different dimensions of management and leadership.</p>

<p>The second layer of the Leadership Lattice is the Organization domain, which is about managing the structures and dynamics of teams.</p>

<p>This includes everything from building cohesion within a single team to organizing business units across a larger organization. There are some shared problems across this spectrum, but the frameworks are very different based on scale.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A guiding mental model I‚Äôve found helpful is that of <em>Organizational Flow</em>. When we do things right to build and align teams in the right way, the organization structures become invisible and we can reach a collective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">‚Äúflow‚Äù state</a>. On an individual level this is defined as ‚Äúthe mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment‚Äù. Getting to this state requires the active practices of alignment, thoughtful organization, conflict resolution - all which are key to this part of the lattice. How this is achieved looks very different in a team vs. a large organization, but ultimately we just want our organizational structures to <em>work</em>. When they do, we‚Äôre in a flow state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In getting to this states, these are some of the practices I‚Äôve found:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Building Organization Structures</li>
      <li>Managing Resource Allocations</li>
      <li>Managing Leadership Teams</li>
      <li>Managing a Team Lifecycle</li>
      <li>Setting Roles and Responsibilities + Creating Autonomy</li>
      <li>Importance of Building Diverse and Inclusive Teams</li>
      <li>Setting Good Team Practices</li>
      <li>Team Culture and Values</li>
      <li>Building Team Cohesion</li>
      <li>Conflict Resolution</li>
      <li>Effective Communication and Dialog</li>
      <li>Building Cohesion Between Teams</li>
      <li>Change Management</li>
      <li>Making Remote Work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some Frameworks used to manage some of the practices above (a very incomplete list for now):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Org Structures: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure#Types">Types of Structures</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/productmanagement101/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761">Squad Framework</a></li>
      <li>Team Lifecycle: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development">Tuckman Stages</a></li>
      <li>Conflict Resolution:</li>
      <li>Culture and Values: Lots of examples, most famous one is <a href="https://www.evolutionpartners.com.au/netflix-core-values-and-culture-statement-a-core-values-example.html">Netflix</a></li>
      <li>Cohesion Between Teams: <a href="https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~mtov/pmcc/modularization.pdf">Amazon ‚ÄúTeam API‚Äù Structure</a></li>

              Productivity Tuesday: Time Tracking Update
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>As part of a productivity practice recently I‚Äôve been actively logging and tracking how I spend my time in increments of 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been doing this for over a month now, and wanted to share some results. The tracking is happening in a Google sheet, and looks like this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/daily-tracking.jpg" alt="Daily Tracking" /></p>

<p>The time tracking is below with color coded cells for each category. Some of the categories are: family time, productive time, sleep, essentials, writing, wasted time, etc. I have them in a bar graph that higlights the total amount per category per day.</p>

<p>In the top rows I also track my to-do list. These are populated based on Weekly/Monthly goals from a regular planning and retrospective practice. In a graph (shown at the bottom of the sheet), I analyze the number of tasks per day, how many I actually complete, and a rolling average of tasks.</p>

<p>Doing this was very unnatural at first but once I started I quickly looked past the inconvenience and got addicted to the data. It gave me an understanding of myself I didn‚Äôt have before.</p>

<p>A few insights I got from the time tracking data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I somewhat expected this when I started my parental leave, but now I have data showing parenting tasks take an average of 8 hours a day, or a full time job.</li>
  <li>The Daily visuals are a great reminder that time is a zero sum game, doing one thing means not doing something else. This improves  prioritization muscles very quickly.</li>
  <li>I can really visualize how messed up my sleep schedule is by seeing the nighttime interruptions.</li>
  <li>Tracking with visuals helps to isolate trends very quickly and I find myself being able to change behaviours quickly with less effort than before.</li>
  <li>30 minute increments create a natural pause for re-evaluating how I‚Äôm spending time. I find myself automatically spending less time on wasted activities like getting caught in the social media and news vortex.</li>
  <li>I still don‚Äôt have the ideal times for the daily habits I‚Äôve committed to - writing, reading and coding.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few insights from the To do Tracking data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was completing tasks at the exact same rate. Whether I had 3 to dos or 10, I maintained a 50% completion rate. This might be consistent over commitment. As soon as I noticed this I tried to actively reduce my to dos and found an increase in the completion - but only by 10%.</li>
  <li>I noticed a dip in completion after days where I completed 100% of tasks. Either a subconscious reward mechanism or burnout.</li>
  <li>Based on this I will try a better structure for task sizing and see if that affects my rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>This practice gives me a great baseline and also a great experiment framework for productivity - I can try new productivity methods and see their impact. I‚Äôll likely continue this for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I‚Äôve stopped this exercise after 3 months. I stopped getting value from it, and found every day to be highly repetitive as a new parent. I may start it up again later.</p>

              Sunk Costs and the Taste Gap
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Creative projects are tough, but especially so when learning a <a href="/20180908/new-crafts-interdisciplinarity.html">new discipline</a> in the process.</p>

<p>During these projects when I hit a major roadblock, I will end up at same decision point: should I keep going, or stop now and save my time?</p>

<p>There are two forces at play in making this decision.</p>

<p>The first is the concept of a creative <strong>taste gap</strong>, which comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE">Ira Glass</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn‚Äôt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. It‚Äôs gonna take awhile. It‚Äôs normal to take awhile. You‚Äôve just gotta fight your way through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The taste gap keeps me fighting my way through creative projects, trying to get my current creative capabilities up to my standard of what is ‚Äúgood‚Äù.</p>

<p>The second force is the <a href="https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/"><strong>sunk cost fallacy</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Individuals commit the sunk cost fallacy when they continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort). This fallacy, which is related to status quo bias, can also be viewed as bias resulting from an ongoing commitment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sunk cost fallacy reminds me that time is limited, and it‚Äôs never a good idea to continue to do something just because I‚Äôve spent time on it already. It‚Äôs better to cut losses and make better use of my time in the future.</p>

<p>Fighting through to project completion is very rewarding. Letting go of a project can be liberating.</p>

<p>Both of these are valid decisions. I‚Äôve been down both these paths and respect each one. They are also classic <a href="https://fs.blog/2018/04/reversible-irreversible-decisions/">reversible</a> decisions. If you give up, you can often come back to the project at a later date. If you keep going, you can revisit that decision at a later time too.</p>

<p>The most important part is that in both choices, there is learning.</p>

              Decentralization, Revisited
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A few days, ago, I <a href="/20180914/web3-decentralization.html">wrote</a> about decentralization as the foundational concept behind <a href="/20180907/future-fridays-web3.html">Web 3</a>. In this post, I wanted to dig into this a bit further - specifically focusing on why the power shift between application developers to protocol developers is so important. Again, there are a <a href="http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols">number</a> of <a href="https://continuations.com/post/105272022635/bitcoin-clarifying-the-foundational-innovation-of">amazing</a> <a href="https://continuations.com/post/148098927445/crypto-tokens-and-the-coming-age-of-protocol">articles</a> that helped me develop my understanding of this topic.</p>

<p>The Internet we know today exists because of two fundamental aspects of software: <strong>protocols</strong> and <strong>applications</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Protocols</strong> are the defined <em>rules</em> of how information is transmitted between computers on the internet. Some of the most important protocols for the today‚Äôs internet are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP">SMTP</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Network_Plus_Certification/Technologies/Common_Protocols">others</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Applications</strong> are what end users interact with. Applications provide additional higher order functions - like presentation, logic, and memory. These higher order functions necessary to create any useful product or service for end users: the <em>presentation layer</em> provides interfaces to interact with, the <em>memory layer</em> (or <em>data layer</em>) provides the ability to store data, and the <em>logic layer</em> provides additional functional capability. Applications <em>use</em> open protocols for communication. For example, Gmail uses the SMTP protocol.</p>

<p>Put together, applications and protocols are the building blocks for today‚Äôs internet applications. This structure is reflected in popular development frameworks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>.</p>

<p>Applications today have <strong>all</strong> the control over the presentation, logic and data of their products and services. This has allowed for incredible innovations, convenience to end users, and ultimately a lot of value created. Application developers today represent some of the most valuable companies in the world. Most importantly, there is an implicit trust built into this architecture - that application developers will always act in the best interest of it‚Äôs users.</p>

<p>We have seen this is not always the case. Application developers can abuse, neglect or be irresponsible with this level of control, and it has major negative downstream impact. The popularity of mobile and internet services makes this level of control a social and political issue around the world. We are seeing this play out in various ways.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the Internet until recently, there really was no <strong>technical solution</strong> to the problem of applications having full control of layers of internet products. Put another way, there was no way to bake in <strong>trust</strong> into applications without a central party. Providing that same level of service meant control over presentation, logic and data.</p>

<p>In 2008, this changed with the arrival of Bitcoin and it‚Äôs underlying invention - the Blockchain.</p>

<p>In technical terms, the Blockchain is a database distributed across multiple computers in the form of a ledger, that uses cryptographic techniques to ensure data cannot be tampered with once ‚Äúwritten to the chain‚Äù. While distributed databases were possible before the blockchain, there was no way to ensure all computers had the same data (without a ‚Äòcentral‚Äô authority) without some novel <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/information/how-does-blockchain-technology-work/">cryptographic functions</a> that made this possible. As Ben Horowitz put it, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to trust any computers - you just have to trust the math‚Äù.</p>

<p>With this technology, multiple computers can come to agreement on the state of an application‚Äôs data and logic without a central party. This is <strong>a framework for <em>data</em> and <em>logic</em> to live outside the application layer, and into the protocol layer itself</strong>.</p>

<p>Without knowing how it all works, just this simple fact is important - <strong>that we can build useful services without giving up control of the data and logic to a single application developer</strong>. This can be an existential threat for some of the most valuable companies in the world which are built on the existing structure of value in the application layer.</p>

<p>Decentralization is the process of making this change - of products and services moving into the shared protocol layer, with fundamentally different incentives and power structures than what exists today.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>It‚Äôs been almost 3 weeks of writing everyday. Some days have been more challenging than others, especially given the unpredictable schedule of managing 3 month old twin girls.</p>

<p>A few reflections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I find myself getting into writing flow faster at night, but end up publishing well past midnight.</li>
  <li><a href="/20180901/theme-days.html">Theme Days</a> have helped eliminate the burden of choice to write about, but some days I end up picking a topic too expansive and spend too much time outlining and researching vs. writing. I also committed to a theme day almost every week, and after a few days, I found it was too much and stopped. The only theme days I‚Äôm doing now are Productivity Tuesdays, Leadership Wednesdays, and Future Fridays.</li>
  <li>Writing is an incredible learning tool, and very quickly highlights gaps in understanding on any topic. Writing an article (vs. just notes) forces ideas to be sequential and follow a natural order. That order requires ideas to build on each other naturally.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm still finding my writing voice. Exploring technical topics is rewarding, but can become draining everyday. Stream of conciousness is fun but not producing anything of real value outside of personal reflections. Despite this, ending the day with productive creative output is pretty rewarding.</li>
  <li>At some point, I‚Äôll probably combine some posts together into longer form essays on some topics.</li>

              Web 3: Decentralization
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is a continuation of the <strong>Future Friday</strong> series on <a href="/20180907/future-fridays-web3.html">Web 3</a>.</p>

<p>Decentralization is the foundational concept of Web 3. Much has already been written on the topic. This article is a collection of quotes and articles that has helped to shape my understanding.</p>

<p>Today, all of our interactions and transactions are done through <em>centralized</em> services like Google, Facebook, Amazon and the like. These companies provide the convenience of services like social networking and search. In exchange, they collect for user data which is then used to sell hyper targeted advertising or other purposes. There is an implict trust placed on these services, and the negative second order effects of this is starting to play out in various ways socially and politically.</p>

<p><strong>Decentralization means that there is no longer the need for an <em>intermediary</em> party required to conduct a verifiable digital transaction or interaction - a fundamental building block for internet services.</strong></p>

<p>This shift from the current state of the internet to a potential decentralized future is described in <a href="https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-web-3-c1a9e74dcae">Making Sense of Web 3</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The internet has gone through major generational shifts before. These expanded the performance, features, and scale of the internet. We went from plaintext websites to streaming video. We went from static web pages to full-featured applications served remotely through the browser. We went from listservs to global social networks that drive modern politics and culture. As the web matured, we grew to rely more and more on a handful of large companies. Google built the fastest and most convenient search engine, and have been rewarded with control over 74% of all search traffic. Facebook built the most popular social network, and was rewarded with control over the online identities of 2.2 billion people.</p>

  <p>Web 3 is different from previous generational shifts. At its core, web 3 isn‚Äôt about speed, performance, or convenience. In fact, many web 3 applications are, at least today, slower and less convenient than existing products.</p>

  <p>Instead, web 3 is about power. It‚Äôs about who has control over the technologies and applications that we use every day. It‚Äôs about breaking the dynamic that has shaped the last decade of the web: the tradeoff between convenience and control. We‚Äôve become so accustomed to this dynamic that it seems inevitable: of course using the internet means being surveilled, and of course having a social media account means having my personal data sold to advertisers or worse. How could it be any other way?</p>

  <p>Web 3 rejects the premise. We can have the benefits of the internet without handing the majority of power to a minority of companies. The dynamic described above isn‚Äôt an iron law of the universe, it‚Äôs just a product of the technology available at the time and the choices we made along the way.</p>

<p><strong>The fundamental innovation that enables decentralization is the Blockchain - it is a open, distributed database in the form of a ledger.</strong> From <a href="https://www.usv.com/blog/bitcoin-as-protocol">Bitcoin as Protocol</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bitcoin ledger is the so-called blockchain which, uses the fact that there are many copies of it that are broadly distributed combined with a fair bit of math <strong>to ensure that once a transaction has been recorded in the blockchain that transaction can not be changed after the fact. There is no other widely used protocol in the world today that accomplishes this</strong>: with bitcoin anyone can make a statement (a transaction) and have this be recorded in a globally visible and fixed ledger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is a big deal, because what the Internet today is missing the the ability to hold and transfer state at the protocol level</strong>, as articulated in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/understanding-web-3-a-user-controlled-internet-a39c21cf83f3">Understanding Web 3 - A User Controlled Internet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today‚Äôs world wide web, or the internet, has two key missing properties: It doesn‚Äôt hold ‚Äústate‚Äù, independent of trusted operators [and] it doesn‚Äôt have a native mechanism to transfer state. Lack of state is a result of the simplicity of the protocols that the web is built on, such as HTTP and SMTP. At any moment, if you were to query a node (a device connected to the internet) about its history or current state, it has no idea. From a user‚Äôs perspective, this would be like using the internet for the first time from a new browser (no history, favorites, saved settings or auto-complete), every time you use anything connected to the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The functions of holding and transferring state are provided by the application layer of the internet today, and have tremendous value. Because of the Blockchain, the protocol layer can hold and transfer state, giving the protocol layer value where it didn‚Äôt exist before. <strong>For the internet, HTTP and underlying protocols don‚Äôt have value. The applications built on top of it, however, went on to create the most profitable companies in the world.</strong></p>

<p>This article entitled <a href="http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols">Fat Protocols</a> describes the relationship between the value of the Protocol layer and Application layer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here‚Äôs one way to think about the differences between the Internet and the Blockchain. The previous generation of shared protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.) produced immeasurable amounts of value, but most of it got captured and re-aggregated on top at the applications layer, largely in the form of data (think Google, Facebook and so on). The Internet stack, in terms of how value is distributed, is composed of ‚Äúthin‚Äù protocols and ‚Äúfat‚Äù applications. As the market developed, we learned that investing in applications produced high returns whereas investing directly in protocol technologies generally produced low returns.</p>

  <p>This relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It‚Äôs a stack with ‚Äúfat‚Äù protocols and ‚Äúthin‚Äù applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>With this fundamental shift comes groundreaking changes in incentives to develop internet services.</strong> From <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e">Why Decentralization Matters</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early internet protocols were technical specifications created by working groups or non-profit organizations that relied on the alignment of interests in the internet community to gain adoption. This method worked well during the very early stages of the internet but since the early 1990s very few new protocols have gained widespread adoption. Cryptonetworks fix these problems by providing economics incentives to developers, maintainers, and other network participants in the form of tokens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôll explore these economic incentives further in next week‚Äôs Future Friday Web 3 series, <strong>Tokens</strong>.</p>

              <p>The rush is that feeling of unbridled optimism. When possibilities feel limitless and the only thing holding you back is how quickly you can take action. It‚Äòs that spark, that adrenaline-filled conversation about that billion dollar idea. The rush is about the future and it‚Äôs potential. It makes you tingle, it makes you move.</p>

<p>The cloud is that feeling of inconsolable pessimism. When everything is difficult and nothing feels good enough. It‚Äôs that voice telling you things will never work, you‚Äôll never be as good as them. It‚Äôs that fear and self doubt so strong that you believe it‚Äôs better not to try at all. The cloud is about the past. It stops you dead in your tracks, it pulls you back.</p>

<p>I hate them <em>both</em>.</p>

<p>They both separate and keep you from the reality. They both give you a false sense of true capabilities. They both convince you of something that isn‚Äôt true, but make you act like it is. Both make you ignore the people closest to you. They both rob you of a full potential to learn.</p>

              Leadership Latticework: The Individual Domain
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This is part of a series of posts about the <strong>Leadership Lattice</strong>, a framework for learning about the different dimensions of management and leadership.</p>

<p>Leadership roles have a massive surface area of accountability, and the process of learning as you go can be challenging. As part of <strong>Leadership Wednesdays</strong>, I‚Äôll be detailing the framework that I use to make the learning easier to manage (and quicker). To get a better understanding of this framework, check out <a href="/20180829/developing-leadership-latticework.html">these</a> <a href="/20180905/leadership-lattice.html">posts</a>.</p>

<p>The first domain of responsibility is that of <strong>Individuals</strong>, which I‚Äôve found to be the most important domain because all management is exercised through people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The guiding mental model I use is ‚Äúthe employee journey. This domain is all about managing individuals through their personal career journey and the time that is spent within your organization. The employee journey has provided me a good encapsulation of that responsibility. The employee journey also highlights where there are missing links - parts of the job that can be simply overlooked.  The responsibility scope starts before an individual is brought on board - how that process actually begins, carries them through their career journey in the organization, and ends with managing their departure if necessary. The relationship can continue beyond that time frame but then falls out of scope of the framework.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going through the employee journey, the following is list of some of those practices:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Hiring Decision</li>
      <li>Sourcing and Interviewing</li>
      <li>Hiring and Onboarding</li>
      <li>Creating paths for growth, development and training</li>
      <li>Understanding individual motivations</li>
      <li>Understanding strengths and weaknesses</li>
      <li>Unlocking individual potential</li>
      <li>Creating clarity in individual objectives and goals</li>
      <li>Managing individual output and performance</li>
      <li>Providing guidance and feedback</li>
      <li>Placement within the organization: promotions and demotions</li>
      <li>Managing their exit, if necessary (firing, quitting, etc)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are hundreds, if not thousands of frameworks to help with the above practices. These come from books, blog posts, and other places. These are the tangibles that help make the practices of leadership easier. These are like tools in a toolbelt. An incomplete list below:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Growth and Development: Training plans, Skills matrix</li>
      <li>Understanding Strengths and Weaknesses: MBTI, Enneagram</li>
      <li>Understanding Motivations: <a href="https://www.theotherperspective.com/daniel-pink-autonomy-mastery-purpose/">Daniel Pink AMP Framework</a></li>

              Productivity Tuesday: Planning and Retrospectives
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In last week‚Äôs Productivity Tuesday, I covered the power of habit-based productivity approaches. Today, I‚Äôll cover the two most foundational habits: planning and retrospectives.</p>

<p>Planning and Retrospectives are the simple practices of thinking forwards and backwards in time. Planning obviously entails outlining the activities required to reach an outcome. Retrospectives entail reflecting on how well you did towards a plan. Both operate on a specific timeframe, and ideally each planning session should have some form of retrospective.</p>

<p>Most people plan to some degree - setting daily to-do‚Äôs, new years resolutions, monthly goals - all are planning exercises. I‚Äôd <em>guess</em> that personal retrospectives aren‚Äôt as common (although I don‚Äôt have any empirical evidence outside of my own experience). I believe it‚Äôs the more important of the two practices.</p>

<p>A good plan has (a) specific timeframe and (b) clear outcomes. A good retrospective answers how well you did against your intention, and where there is opportunity to improve.</p>

<p>Planning and retrospectives are the foundational habits, and they create the space to reflect and plan for any additional personal improvements - whatever it may be.</p>

<p>I do some form of both on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.</p>

<p>On a daily basis, plans include to do‚Äôs - discrete tasks and habits I‚Äôm actively tracking (currently, daily reading, writing, and coding). A daily retrospective is very quick - marking completed discrete tasks, and tracking which habits I actually stuck to. I currently daily plans in Google Sheets, of all things, because it helps me track my to-do completion rate (to see how much I overcommit), and measure habit streaks (there are some great apps to do all this individually, but a spreadsheet let‚Äôs me customize and analyse easily).</p>

<p>On a weekly basis, planning and retrospective happens together, about 30 minutes per week. Plans are divided into 2 sections. Goals (groups of discrete tasks I need to complete) and the habits I want to either start, improve upon, or stop. Given I‚Äôm on a parental leave, I‚Äôm limiting this to 1 group of discrete tasks a week, 1-2 improvements in habits. I do weekly planning in <a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a>, and my retrospective notes are added to the end of the plan from the previous week.</p>

<p>On a monthly basis, I follow largely the same structure as weekly, do the planning in Simplenote, and make notes about how well I was able to follow through on plans. Monthly plans take an extended period, I like to take 1-2 hours, sit outside and reflect on the month.</p>

<p>I use multiple frameworks for longer term planning and retrospectives, which deserve a separate post of themselves.</p>

              Mental Model: Compound Interest
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Compound interest (<em>compounding</em>) is a powerful force, and one of the most versatile <a href="/20180903/mental-models.html">mental models</a>. Compounding ‚Äúis the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit‚Äù. I like the simpler framing ‚Äú<a href="https://medium.com/@jaymehoffman/7-mental-models-i-live-my-life-by-e79742d4f074">growth on your previous growth</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>Compounding is versatile. It‚Äôs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">mathematical</a> concept that is the foundation for modern finance, but can be applied to almost anything - <a href="https://medium.com/@HowieDiamond/compound-knowledge-288292b4503d">knowledge</a>, capability, ideas, relationships, product growth, and more.</p>

<p>Some sub-concepts about compounding, that can also be applied outside mathematics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You have to have a non-zero starting point.</strong> You cannot compound on nothing. That‚Äôs obvious with money. To compound knowledge, that includes the basics of whatever field is being studied. In relationships, a base of trust must be first established to build upon over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequency has a massive effect.</strong> Frequency is how often the benefit of compounding is realized, and has a huge effect on the outcome. Allocating time to whatever you <em>want</em> to compound can be achieved by building consistent <a href="/20180904/productivity-tuesday-habits.html">habits</a>. Frequency of regular contributions will significantly amplify the effects of compounding.</li>
  <li><strong>The passage of time is necessary.</strong> Compounding plays out over the long term. In the short term, the incremental gains can be hard to notice. It changes attitudes about the future and helps to appreciate becoming older.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like this quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103908947263488">Naval Ravikant</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.</p>

              Changing Minds
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I recently tried to find some cases of when large groups of people <em>changed their minds</em>. I came across a few interesting articles about how that‚Äôs happened in different contexts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This article, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/i-dont-want-to-be-right">I Don‚Äôt Want to Be Right</a> from the New Yorker in 2014 talks about a study about changing minds about vaccinations - and how a pure fact based approach doesn‚Äôt work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/7/11380974/reduce-prejudice-science-transgender">Vox</a> wrote about a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1366">scientific study</a> conducted that shows the impact authentic dialogue plays in changing attitudes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_principle">Planck‚Äôs Principle</a> is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views. Essentially, you can‚Äôt change minds - you just have to wait for people to die. I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs an equivalent theory regarding social progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great article from HBR called <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/07/how-social-movements-change-minds">How Social Movements Change Minds</a> talks about the attributes of successful social movements - how they start by attacking perception, grow through building connections, and connect to the mainstream.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One great quote from the article above:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That‚Äôs a lesson we‚Äôve seen over and over in the social movements of the last century‚Äîalthough the outside observer may only notice the movement when the dominoes start falling, the people inside the movement worked tirelessly for months, years, or even decades, to change minds.</p>

              New Crafts &amp; Interdisciplinarity

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>One of the things I enjoy most is learning and applying the basics of different creative disciplines and fields of work. I‚Äôve found tremendous value in just learning how to do things myself. Even if it means spending an inordinate amount of time or money learning vs. just buying something off the shelf or paying someone. In some cases, even if it led to less than ideal outcomes, the learning along the way always makes it worthwhile.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting part is how work in unrelated discipline has affected the work of building software. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I bought a home and needed to furnish it, I learned the basics of woodworking and joinery to build custom furniture. Buying it off the shelf would have been infinitely easier. It gave me an appreciation for physical craftsmanship, tolerances, decision reversibility, and maintaining clean workspaces. There are direct parallels to many of these in the world of creating software.</li>
  <li>In 2006 I moved to Mumbai for a few months on a work assignment. I was inspired by the energy of the city, and decided to create some graphic tees as a creative expression. Along the way, I learned how to screen-print, developed an e-commerce store, and setup a small business selling shirts. That experience introduced me to the world of graphic design, selling shirts gave me an understanding of unit economics, and opened me to the world of streetwear through the lens of a creator. I still wear some of those shirts today!</li>
  <li>I never grew up playing any role in our family kitchen. When I moved out, I had to force myself how to cook to save money. It also became a creative expression of sorts. Cooking has helped me exercise experimentation, improvisation, and reinforced the need for a clean workspace - all skills that can be applied across disciplines. Joel Spolsky wrote <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/programmers-and-chefs/">a great post</a> on the parallels between chefs and programmers.</li>
</ul>

<p>In writing for this post, I stumbled into an similar academic concept called <strong>interdisciplinarity</strong> - the ‚Äúcombination of two or more academic disciplines in one activity‚Äù. More on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity">here</a>.</p>

              <p>The blockchain is an invention at the foundation of the largest change in technology since the internet itself.</p>

<p>While most of the news cycle about blockchain centers around cryptocurrencies, the more interesting application of the blockchain is not <em>just</em> in the future of money, but also the future of the how the internet works. There is a fantastic article about this by Erik Torenberg titled <a href="https://www.atrium.co/blog/money-tech-crypto/">Money Crypto vs Tech Crypto</a>.</p>

<p>This paradigm shift has been dubbed <strong>Web 3</strong>. This post is intended to dive deeper into some fundamental concepts that can help us understand Web 3.</p>

<p>I believe many of these concepts, or some consumer friendly abstractions of them, will become well known and understood in the mainstream within a decade. Examples of such technology abstractions that almost everyone in the world knows about today are ‚Äúvisiting‚Äù a website (from the world of web 1.0), ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù with someone on social media (from web 2.0).</p>

<p>When I started writing this post, I intended to write about all the concepts in one post. Once I got started, it was clear that it‚Äôs too much. So, I‚Äôm going to spend the next few weeks examining the following concepts and their impact on end users.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralization - the foundational concept of the blockchain. I‚Äôll examine how the blockchain helps  fulfills the original promise of the web. I‚Äôll look at how it will breaks down walled gardens and gives control back into the hands of the people (and why that‚Äôs important).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tokens and Digital Ownership - I‚Äôll examine the incorruptibility promise of the blockchain ledger and how it inherently creates value. This gives rise to transfer and ownership of digital assets and tokens. This is how the blockchain is making money a ‚Äúnative function of the internet‚Äù.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trust and Consensus - I‚Äôll examine the concepts of how blockchains enable market consensus, the incentives associated, how trust in decentralized networks is built, and how it can be applied more widely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building Decentralized Services - In this final week, I‚Äôll look at what this means for entrepreneurs and developers. Tokens have the potential to change  the current state of the web3 development stack, with a particular emphasis of how developers today need to shift their thinking in a world of decentralized development.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are number of amazing resources already available on all these topics, which I‚Äôll link to during each week.</p>

              <p>I was talking to someone in their early 20‚Äôs recently about their careers. I advised them that financial literacy is probably the most important skill they can develop early on, and it will help them no matter what direction their career takes.</p>

<p>I believe financial literacy is an essential skill that should be taught to everyone as early as possible. It includes an understanding of some core concepts like: basic numeracy, risk and diversification, compounding interest, inflation, and volatility.</p>

<p>A big part of it ofcourse is developing strong, interntional practices in personal finance - debt and credit, income management, budgeting, investing and taxes. However, it also includes an understanding of broader economic systems and why things work the way they do.</p>

<p>I found a really interesting <a href="https://responsiblefinanceforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-Finlit_paper_17_F3_SINGLES.pdf">global survey of financial literacy</a>, which contains some startling results of literacy across a number of segments.</p>

<p>One of the most startling statistics was of India, where less than 25% of adults are considered financially literate.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm happy that in Ontario, we have a <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/surveyLiteracy.html">program</a> to improving financial literacy - starting in Grade 4 and going up to grade 12. The program includes personal finance, consumer awareness, economic understanding and citizenship.</p>

              Building The Leadership Lattice
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôm kicking off this post following up on the domains of responsibilty outlined in <a href="/20180829/developing-leadership-latticework.html">developing a leadership latticework</a>. This learning framework is simply an outline of the areas for which leaders are either directly responsible or accountable.</p>

<p>As a refresher, the domains of responsibility outlined were (updated with links):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/20181010/leadership-lattice-self-management.html">The Domain of Self Management</a>, concerned with managing yourself as a leader</li>
  <li><a href="/20180912/leadership-practice-individual-domain.html">The Individual Domain</a>, concerned with the management and growth of individuals</li>
  <li><a href="/20180919/leadership-latticework-organization.html">The Organization Domain</a>, concerned with how people organize to work together</li>
  <li><a href="/20180927/leadership-lattice-application-domain.html">The Application Domain</a>, concerned with the specific outputs and outcomes of an organization.</li>
  <li><a href="/20181004/leadership-lattice-impact-domain.html">The Impact Domain</a>, concerned with the broader impacts of the organization‚Äôs collective output</li>
</ul>

<p>In following weeks, I‚Äôll be examining each domain by detailing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guiding Mental Models: These mental models that can help understand the overall responsibility scope of the domain.</li>
  <li>Practices: This outlines the specific practices of the domain. These cover the responsibility scope in more detail.</li>
  <li>Frameworks: Here I‚Äôll cover some of the frameworks that I‚Äôve picked up along the way that have helped me in the practices above. The sources of these frameworks come from everywhere - experience, blog posts, books.</li>
  <li>Other Resources: Specific people, authors, books or websites I‚Äôve found to be a great source of information related to this domain of leadership.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I come across new sources of knowledge, this framework has helped me file things away, compare one technique to another, or just simply clarify what the job actually is. I want to emphasize that this is my personal framework of <em>learning</em>. Hopefully, the structure can be useful to someone other than myself as well.</p>

<p>Next week, I‚Äôll cover the Individual Domain, which is concerned with management at an individual level.</p>

              Managing Habits
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Productivity is the art of practicing leadership on yourself. In <strong>Productivity Tuesday</strong>, I‚Äôll reflect and share on that practice, and of bridging the gap between intention and the outcomes we seek. Whatever I share by way of advice and tips will come with some kind of empirical evidence or insight from personal experience.</p>

<p>The first PT is about habits.</p>

<p>Habits are a contrast to one the default framework of productivity - <em>goal oriented thinking</em>. Goals are great in that they provide a clear definition of an end state, typically accompanied by a deadline.</p>

<p>Habits are defined as routines of behaviour that <em>repeat regularly</em> and <em>tend to occur subconciously</em>.</p>

<p>Habits can be an extremely powerful framework to achieve our desired outcomes, and have a number of  benefits over the traditional goal-oriented thinking in the context of daily productivity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">good goalsetting practice</a> in everyday life can be a very cumbersome exercise. In particular, it‚Äôs hard to tell if something is achievable over a long period of time due to inherent uncertainties in life.</li>
  <li>Habits are easier and show progress quickly. Streaks of progress release endorphins that keep you going. Instead of trying to publish a novel, simply writing <em>something</em> <a href="/20180827/starting-a-new-habit.html">every day</a>, is much less daunting and requires less continual willpower.</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, habits aren‚Äôt for everything. I have recently moved to augmenting my daily routine with a combination of a discrete goal-based and habit based framework. The habit based framework is extremely simple - within a given time period (weeks/months), I define habits to either create, improve, or remove. I‚Äôve only experimented with habits that recur daily. These include - reading, writing something, coding. For the last few weeks, I‚Äôve been able to maintain a daily habit of all 3. In the next few weeks, I‚Äôll attempt to rebuild a workout habit with this framework.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also started <a href="/20180830/time.html">tracking</a> these habits.</p>

<p>A recommendation - the first habit to setup is a cycle of regular planning and self reflection. Regular planning at the beginning of, and retrospective at the end of every day/week/month is your personal knowledge and learning loop. It defines the cadence of improving and adjusting your other habits.</p>

<p>A lot of this comes thinking from <a href="https://fs.blog/2017/06/habits-vs-goals/">this article</a> from the Farnam Street blog, and this <a href="https://twitter.com/internetVin/status/1019033516028280832">tweetstorm</a>.</p>

              Mental Models
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>In the past year, one of the most transformative practices I‚Äôve found is to be more intentional about my own and other people‚Äôs mental models. It provides clarity of thought, changed how I learn, and improved my decision making.</p>

<p>A mental model is a simplified representation of the world around us. It can come in the form of an assumption, generalization or even an image. We use models to understand the world around us, and our models directly influence our actions.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve found them valuable:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learning with the intention of ‚Äúcollecting mental models‚Äù is easier and more practical than learning through fact. Learning a new model is like getting a new tool in a toolbox that can be easily used in different situations.</li>
  <li>It provides a more complete picture of the world. People from different disciplines and backgrounds provide ways of looking at the world that helps us better understand each other and make better decisions for everyone.</li>
  <li>We act implicitly through mental models, so understanding how others use mental models is critical to building relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are probably countless mental models in the world, and a good place to start is to understand the broadest fields of study and the key models for each one. For example, for economics the model of supply and demand is critical. In biology, evolution is a central model.</p>

<p>There are some excellent resources mental models <a href="https://jamesclear.com/mental-models">here</a>, <a href="https://www.fs.blog/mental-models/">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am also <a href="/20180829/developing-leadership-latticework.html">writing</a> about the practice of building a latticework of mental models to become a better leader. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254">The Fifth Discipline</a> is an excellent resource about mental models in the context of leadership.</p>

              Baseline with Self Curiosity
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I‚Äôve approached many self improvement challenges recently by starting with a practice of self curiosity before taking action or making a major decision on what to improve.</p>

<p>For example, when trying to make sure I was eating right and drinking enough water, I started by keeping a log of how many glasses of water I‚Äôm drinking daily. I didn‚Äôt make any <em>intentional</em> changes.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why this approach works well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is a great way to get a baseline understanding of what is happening now. It helps to make sure I know how much I need to improve something - whether a gradual or more drastic approach to change is necessary.</li>
  <li>It establishes a habit of measurement before any changes are actually made. This habit is just as important than the change itself.</li>
  <li>The act of measurement always creates some change in behaviour - often for the better.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few areas where self-curiosity has been critical:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time tracking: I‚Äôve become curious about <a href="/20180830/time.html">how I‚Äôm spending my time</a>, with the ultimate goal of making sure I‚Äôm spending an appropriate amount of time on the things that matter to me most.</li>
  <li>Anxiety journals: I‚Äôve started to write about the situations that give me anxiety or make me uncomfortable. The journal is a simple note of what happened (objective) and how it made me feel (subjective). This has helped avoid me making bad decisions when I‚Äôm anxious, and helped understand my response to certain situations. Putting it into writing immediately relieves some degree of anxiety, as it feels like some action is being taken.</li>
  <li>Productivity Retrospectives: I started a daily/weekly/monthly reviews to measure how many goals and to-do‚Äôs I intended to complete vs. which ones I actually completed. This retrospective has revealed patterns of overcommitment that I always felt I had, but now have empirical evidence to prove it, and change accordingly.</li>
  <li>Tracking Food and Water intake: without actively making any changes to what and how I eat, the act of tracking has already improved my eating habits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even after only a few months of these habits, I can already see how these small changes can have major impact over time.</p>

              Theme Days
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>One of the biggest challenges I‚Äôve found in developing a <a href="/20180827/starting-a-new-habit.html">writing habit</a> is choosing what to write about. While there is no shortage of ideas, choosing between them has been challenging. So, I‚Äôm going to try to start theming my writing based on the Day of the week. Some of my favourite bloggers do the same - <a href="http://www.avc.com">Fred Wilson</a> and <a href="http://www.continuations.com">Albert Wenger</a>.</p>

<p>So, here‚Äôs a tentative list of the theme days. Hopefully this reduces the burden of choice and just like building a writing habit itself, puts certain parts of the process on autopilot.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Productivity Tuesdays</strong>, in which I‚Äôll discuss topics centered around the theme of personal betterment and productivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Leadership Wednesday</strong>, where I‚Äôll write about topics related to management. I‚Äôll likely use this <a href="/20180829/developing-leadership-latticework.html">latticework</a> to start structuring topics.</li>
  <li><strong>Future Friday</strong>, where I‚Äôll write about specific trends in technology and try to make some predictions about how things might develop.</li>
</ul>

<p>On other days, I‚Äôll leave it open to other topics. This might be too much structure already but I‚Äôm looking forward to reducing some burden of choice, and just write. I‚Äôm not sure. Let‚Äôs see.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I‚Äôve changed these recently based on experience over the last week. I initially had 5 theme days a week, and found it to be too much structure and made writing less enjoyable. The changes to this post show the edits I made.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I‚Äôve <a href="/20181117/ending-theme-days.html">ended theme days</a>. It works for some, but it just didn‚Äôt for me.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>Everyone who knows me well enough has heard this story multiple times. It‚Äôs an important part of my identity, and something I think about frequently as a new parent.</p>

<p>My childhood was characterized by movement - my father worked as an officer in the Indian Diplomatic corps, and we moved to different countries in three year stretches until I was 18, when I settled in Canada.</p>

<p>I was born in New Delhi, India in July of 1981.  When I was an infant, we moved to Copenhagen, Denmark. My parents tell me I spoke Danish pretty well but I remember none of it.</p>

<p>The next post was Lilongwe, Malawi, a small country above South Africa. I started school in Malawi at a British School.</p>

<p>In 1991, we moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This was the time of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">first Gulf War</a>. It was a scary time to live in the region, in the shadow of constant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXOQ9cDwxLY">scud missile attacks</a>.</p>

<p>In 1994 we returned to New Delhi and spent 2 years at an Army School.</p>

<p>Following that was 3 years in Manila, Philippines, where I started high school at the incredible <a href="http://www.ismanila.org/">International School of Manila</a>.</p>

<p>I arrived in Toronto, Canada in 1997. I moved out and went to <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">university</a> and after 3 years, my parents continued their travels and went to Ethiopia, Ottawa and Brasillia. I visited them frequently wherever they were, but eventually settled and became a Citizen in 2013.</p>

<p>I love Toronto and Canada and the fact that it provides exposure to so many cultures. That said, I always appreciated the depth of cultural diversity in my childhood - especially so now that I‚Äôm a parent myself.</p>

              Time Tracking
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>I started an experiment recently to start tracking how I‚Äôm my spending time in 30 minute increments. Because I‚Äôm actively updating it, it is a more empirical view of my time than I‚Äôve ever had before, and is pretty enlightening.</p>

<p>The tracking itself is simple and done in a Google spreadsheet, and is really easy to update through the Sheets mobile app. I chose to do this in a spreadsheet vs. a calendar or tracking app because it allows for more control in inputs and greater flexibility in analysis. Each row represents a 30 minute block, and each column is a day. Each increment is assigned a category: family time, sleep, work, chores, etc. I try to be as detailed as possible, and also have included daily to do‚Äôs in this spreadsheet.</p>

<p>This sounds intense but since it only takes a few seconds to update and I‚Äôve found it quite manageable - infact, it‚Äôs strangely addictive. I‚Äôve been doing this for 2 weeks, so still a long ways to go before it becomes an engrained habit.</p>

<p>It has already helped me become more deeply curious about myself and improved a pattern of daily and weekly reflection.  Since my todo‚Äôs are also in the spreadsheet, I‚Äôm able to track how much I committed to vs. what I completed, and other interesting trends in productivity.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm really enjoying this exercise I will definitely be sharing more of insight in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<p>As a note, I recognize the view of time being more valuable than money is in itself is a privilege, because the anxiety and cognitive load of financial burdens is overpowering. I consider myself extremely lucky to even be able to do something like this.</p>

              Developing a Leadership Latticework
            </a>
<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>There is no shortage of management and leadership advice. Consuming and processing it in an attempt to improve one‚Äôs abilities is daunting. This post is about a framework for <strong>learning</strong> within the domains of management and leadership. The goal is to provide a structured latticework that can help pick up new skills like tools in a tool box. Given the expansive set of advice and knowledge freely available on the topic of management and leadership, a framework for learning was necessary for me.</p>

<p>This approach to learning is similar to that of mental models. The notion of creating a latticework as a means to learn was popularized by <a href="https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html">Charlie Munger</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, the first rule is that you can‚Äôt really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ‚Äôem back. If the facts don‚Äôt hang together on a latticework of theory, you don‚Äôt have them in a usable form. You‚Äôve got to have models in your head. And you‚Äôve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You‚Äôve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The framework itself is quite simple - it is a list of all of the domains of leadership, and how they interact with each other as a system. My experience is in the private sector - specifically that of software startups - but some parts of this are applicable outside of that context as well.</p>

<p>To built the latticework, it starts with a simple observation of what‚Äôs going on in a corporation:</p>

<p><strong>Individuals working together, making decisions and executing towards positive outcomes and meaningful impact.</strong></p>

<p>This is a very generic description, and seems simplistic, but for me helped to cover the scope of outcomes for which I was directly or indirectly responsible.</p>

<p>I then broke this down further to highlight <strong>the domains of responsibility of a leader</strong>. The domains further detail the scope of the role, which is the starting point to building a learning framework.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self Domain, concerned with managing your own well being as a leader.</li>
  <li>Individual Domain, concerned with management at an individual level</li>
  <li>Organization Domain, concerned with how people organize and effectively work together</li>
  <li>Application Domain: concerned with the specifics of outputs and outcomes of the organization. Outputs are are specific to a functional area - some teams create products, others services, and others sell what is being created. Outcomes are how customers interact with them, be it an external market or internal users. There is a tight feedback loop between the two, which is why these live in the same domain.</li>
  <li>Impact Domain, concerned with the broader impacts of what‚Äôs being created</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a system in which these domains are highly connected to each other, and they interact with the adjacent ones. Individual impact teams, teams impact outputs, etc.</p>

<p>In further posts, I‚Äôll expand on each domain. I will also ‚Äústress test‚Äù this framework through my personal experience and practice, as well as through examining how battle-tested leadership practices can be added into this approach. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing when and how this breaks.</p>

<!--             <div class="content">
              <p>This blog is completely <a href="https://github.com/tarunsachdeva/blog/">open source</a>. It is based on the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> library, which helps people create static sites, and is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hosting it myself gives me complete control of the format and content. Maintenance is fairly easy despite the extra steps. This is just a static site so I‚Äôm just editing Markdown files. Jekyll has great integration with Github and an active community to help with any issues.</li>
  <li>I like the development workflow for writing. Git let‚Äôs me track changes in an <a href="https://github.com/tarunsachdeva/blog/commits/gh-pages">extremely detailed</a> way. All my edits are available for anyone to see, which creates a strange sense of vulnerability and accountability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything here is boilerplate Jekyll. A few small modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>I‚Äôve slightly <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima#customization">modified</a> the default theme (<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a>), and changes can be seen in commits in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_sass</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> directories in the <a href="https://github.com/tarunsachdeva/blog/">repo</a>.</del> Update: I‚Äôm now using a modified version of the  <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/primer">Primer</a> theme instead of Minima.</li>
  <li>The blog lives in a subdirectory based on instructions from <a href="http://shahrajat.com/2016-06-22-install-jekyll-subdirectory-blog-github-pages/">this article</a>).</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm using draft posts in the way described by <a href="https://gist.github.com/carlo/2870636">this simple solution</a> (drafts are enabled in Jekyll natively through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_drafts</code> folder, but I like this solution bettter.)</li>
  <li>URL structure updated so it doesn‚Äôt include categories (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permalink</code> in <a href="https://github.com/tarunsachdeva/blog/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code></a>)</li>
  <li>Tags display will be added soon (I like <a href="http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/">this approach</a>).</li>

              <p>I‚Äôm starting a blog.</p>

<p>The primary purpose will be to <strong>develop a regular writing habit</strong>. I‚Äôll start by using writing as a means to clarify my understanding of certain topics, explore an area of interest, or share something I‚Äôve found repeatedly useful.  As such, this is primarily self serving.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll cover topics related to the work of building products and teams in tech for over 15 years, as well as the experience of growing up around the world and immigrating to Canada. I‚Äôll explore topics I‚Äôm interested in: the promise &amp; peril of a world being eaten by software, developing strong mental models, systems thinking, design and craft, personal productivity, and being a new parent.</p>

<p>So yeah, basically a lot of random shit to start off.</p>

<p>Everyday I will try to post something new, or at least expand on something I‚Äôve posted earlier.</p>
