  <h2>Developing a Writing Voice</h2>
  

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I was talking to a friend recently about writing, and I shared how I’m struggling with finding a writing voice. When I re-read my posts, the tone, tense and vocabulary feels a little foreign. Some of this may be because of the topics I’ve chosen to explore or write about, but something just feels off.</p>

<p>The words don’t reflect me just yet, something that feels like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY">creative gap</a>.</p>

<p>He told me about the Welsh poet named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas">Dylan Thomas</a> and how he would write the same sentence fifty different ways until he found a style that worked for him. I wasn’t able to find any evidence of that but still feels like a worthwhile technique to try.</p>

<p>I decided to pick one sentence from my earlier posts and rewrite it until I became comfortable with it. I chose this sentence at random, from an earlier post entitled <a href="/20180902/self-curiosity.html">Self Curiosity</a>:</p>

<p>Original: I’ve approached many self improvement challenges recently by starting with a practice of self curiosity before taking action or making a major decision on what to improve.</p>

<p>Rewrites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I’m approaching new self improvement challenges by becoming curious about how I’m doing things today, before taking action or making a major decision on how to improve.</li>
  <li>Before I try any self improvement, I want to learn how I’m doing things today, so I can better understand what and how much I need to improve.</li>
  <li>Starting with curiosity helps to set a baseline for my current behavior, so I know exactly what and how much I need to improve.</li>
  <li>Getting better at something requires an understanding of what is happening today.</li>
  <li>The first step to self improvement is understanding. Trying to change a habit without knowing how much change is needed is a futile exercise.</li>
  <li>The first step to any self improvement is understanding yourself. Trying to make a change in your life without fully understanding how much change is needed leads to wasted effort.</li>
  <li>The first step to self improvement is understanding yourself. It reveals the extent of change needed, and helps you increase your chance of success.</li>
  <li>Self improvement often focuses on the new behavior that need to be adopted. But the most useful thing I’ve done before trying to create new behaviors is first understanding myself.</li>
  <li>Step 1 of any self improvement practice has to be establishing a baseline of current behavior. It’s an easy first step that helps you understand the scope of change needed.</li>
  <li>Self improvement starts with introspection - understanding what you’re doing today, so you know what (and how much) you need to improve.</li>
  <li>I used to approach self improvement by immediately trying to change my behavior. Now, I start with introspection - understanding what I’m doing today. It requires almost no effort, and helps me understand where and how I need to improve.</li>
  <li>I now start any self improvement with introspection - an understanding of what I’m doing today. It takes little effort, and helps me understand how much I really need to improve.</li>
</ul>
